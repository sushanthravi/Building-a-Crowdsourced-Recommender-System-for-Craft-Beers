Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"Boxed beer at home, proper glassware. Pitch black, oily thick pour with a brown head that quickly disappears. Maple upfront alongside roasted coffee, bourbon in the nose.

Big bodied, oily rich mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Truly one of a kind beer, brewed to perfection.",4.7,0.9423

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"There are not hundreds of beers on my bucketlist anymore, throughout the years I have had the pleasure of tasting many of the world's great beers and I am grateful for each and every one of them, but if there is one beer I have been eager to sip for nearly a decade now, it must be this one: Toppling Goliath's Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout, or KBBS as it is sometimes abbreviated.  A coffee stout aged for over a year in bourbon barrels, it was first released in 2012, but the story goes that at that time, only six people showed up - after which founder Carl Lewey stopped selling it and kept the rest of the batch for private consumption.  I guess he must have known already back then that he was onto something, as the buzz around this beer began to grow and it quickly became one of those modern whales every beer lover in the world wants to taste at least once.  In 2015, KBBS reached number one in the list of top beers on this very website, stoking the hype even further; nine years later, it still holds that same enviable position, as it does on BeerAdvocate (as well as second place - though only recently - on Untappd and Brewver).  It goes without saying that I am very happy to be able to finally taste it today on my birthday, from a 2022 vintage bottle (numbered 1679) just over a year old - and of course I know that a beer like this will probably only improve in coming years, but I just could not resist having it in my collection any longer...  Builds up a light brown, mocha ice-coloured, minute-bubbled and therefore densely creamy head of medium thickness, slowly receding and opening yet retaining well around the edge, with some dots of lacing here and there, over a pitch black beer.  The bouquet is intense - and indeed overwhelmingly beautiful, one sniff already managed to convince me instantly of the whole hype around it: top quality Swiss chocolate, chocolate ganache, top class real maple syrup, the finest Colombian coffee, warm bourbon of some high-end brand, vanillin-breathing oak wood and a lot of it (I love it), homemade coffee brownies, Alicante nougat, armagnac, fudge, expensive Belgian chocolates, crème au caramel, artisanal mocha ice cream, coffee liqueur, more dark bitter chocolate underneath and then all kinds of subtle hints ticking all the boxes of a high-level U.S. style 'impy' varying between almond, roasted pecan nuts, cinnamon, fresh bayleaf, pipe tobacco, fresh fig and even more fruitiness warming up (blackcurrant) but then making room again for wet leather, walnut oil, charcoal briefly showing up only to vanish again in seconds, haemoglobin, rum-soaked raisins, date jam, a very vague minerally touch (clay) - before all that dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak return, all intertwined into one monolithic, perfectly aligned and beguiling 'block' of aroma.  In the mouth, the most noble and refined sweetness unfolds, date jam, candied cherries, golden raisins - in a very dense, concentrated manner, with very slight sourish and umami notes here and there, but too subtle to describe; mouthfeel and carbonation are absolutely perfect for this style of beer, rich, velvety, viscously thick yet still oily-smooth, heavily yet supply gliding down the tongue, leaving behind thick layers of fine dark chocolate, toffee, nougat, almond and hazelnut paste, with both the coffee and roasted malts providing bitterness balancing out the sweetness.  An overall bittersweetness fills the mouth in a most complex way, releasing accents of amaretto, bayleaf, cinnamon, light sweet pipe tobacco and, much lighter still, even 'blood' or the juice oozing out of a medium rare steak - all of which matches perfectly without even the slightest sign of a false note, and all of which is enveloped in a noble oaky woodiness (think vanilla and actual wood flavours) and, of course, a long, warming, soothing bourbon bittersweetness, bourbon of high quality in this case, with armagnac- and walnut liqueur-like features.  The finish goes on and on, warming on a cold January night, but more importantly, providing an extended enjoyment of this formidable brew which seems to last forever.  Hops are present 'behind the scenes', with spicy and even very faintly citrus peel-ish details that all contribute to the vast and massive landscape of flavours.  The coffee returns every now and then retronasally, in a most sophisticated way.  This is one to enjoy very slowly and over a very long period of time: as the temperatures shift, one shade of beauty is replaced by another.  This is the one beer I spent the most money on in my twenty-five years of tasting beer in a serious way, but I have no regrets - on the contrary, I am filled with joy and gratitude that after such a long time, this most coveted of the world's craft beers (or one of the most coveted at least) finally reached me.  The number of bottles released each year seems to have grown in past iterations, probably since Toppling Goliath extended their production capacity with a new brewing installment in 2018, so who knows, maybe one day this gem will become a bit more widely available, and when that happens, I will be happy to pay for a second one.  As for now, I suppose I could consider selling the empty bottle, as I noticed one being auctioned in the States for no less than a hundred dollars...  Anyway, to conclude this long journey through this awe-inspiring brew: I think scoring becomes a bit meaningless in the light of not only this beer's inherent perfection and majestic beauty, but also in its consistent high scores in the decade in which it has been in existence.  Additionally, I cannot find anything I do not like here, not even after examining it with a microscope, so to speak, so here you go: the perfect score, mostly symbolically because American style imperial stout really does not get much better than this, at least not in what I have tasted so far.",5.0,0.9993

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"12 oz bottle. Pours nearly pitch black color and capped by a small tan layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves some nice legging on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and roasted coffee over a dark roasted malt base with further notes of bourbon and oak laden vanilla. The maple syrup is dominant but the underlying chocolate, coffee, and oaky vanilla shines as it warms up. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and maple syrup right up front along with the bourbon oak, vanilla, and a moderate bitterness for balance on the back end. The maple syrup is sweet but tastes like quality grade A stuff compared to fake adjuncts found in other similar beers. Full bodied and slick with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and bourbon oak on the finish with lingering maple syrup sweetness after each sip. This is really tasty and definitely one of the better maple stouts I’ve had for sure, but not sure it quite lives up to the hype or the price to get it. Still a great beer.",4.3,0.974

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"2016. Silver Wax. Bottle 332. So intense! Aroma: Tons of sweet bourbon, maple syrup (more and more after warming up), good choco, molasses, vanilla, a bit walnuts. Perfect. Taste: The same + sour coffee and dark fruits. 4.75/5

// Aromat nieziemski, piorunująco intensywny. Mnóstwo słodkiego bourbonu, syrop klonowy (po czasie coraz bardziej wyczuwalny), melasa, wysokiej jakości czekolada, beczkowa wanilia, z czasem doszły jeszcze włoskie orzechy. Nie wąchałem nic, co by tak doskonale pachniało. Przez pierwsze pół godziny wziąłem tylko jednego łyka, a resztę czasu tylko niuchałem to cudo. Ocena 5/5 to mało.
Pierwszy łyk i wow, gęste w kurwę. W zasadzie powtórka tego, co w zapachu + dochodzi jeszcze kwaskowata kawa i ciemno-czerwone owoce. Alkohol po ogrzaniu się skromnie pojawia, ale jest maksymalnie szlachetny, taki typowo od beczki.
Za smak daję 4.75 i to głównie za kompleksowość. Subiektywnie może nawet ""tylko"" 4.50 (nie przepadam za kwaśną kawą) - dosyć mocno przypominał mi niektóre kawowe RIS-y z Cycle - główna różnica, to lepiej ułożony alkohol.
Ten aromat długo będzie za mną chodził po nocach.",4.8,0.8447

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",4.8,0.997

Overall
Incredibly big, intense and extremely vinous. With fascinating tertiary aroma in the glass, I was likely to feel as though it's an old Recioto. One of the best mead I've ever had.
令人难以置信的宏大和集中，同时像极了葡萄酒。杯中涌现出迷人的三类香气，让人有种在喝老年份雷乔托的感觉。我喝过的最好的蜂蜜酒之一。

Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"SARAthon 2022. Pours a deep red/purple color with no carbonation and nice legs. Insane fruit character. Tons of cherry juice and flesh, raspberry, and currant. Quite vinous and has a really nice tannin and acid profile to it. Notes of cocoa, caramel, honey, and a touch of spice. Like a cherry and berry pie. Incredibly rich fruit and honey character and a nice full body. Probably still not worth the price (to me anyway), but really excellent.",4.5,0.8945

Westvleteren 12,"BESTES QUADRUPPEL!!! UND BESTES BIER DER WELT!!!
Das Westvleteren 12 führt einige Tasting Listen an und ist auf Youtube auch unter dem Begriff ""Bestes Bier der Welt"" zu finden. Es kommt dunkelbraun mit beiger, gemischtporiger Krone ins Glas, die eine mittlere Standfestigkeit hat. Der Geruch erinnert an einen Mostkeller mit hohem erdigen Anteil. Besonders auffällig ist der Alkohol. Beim Antrunk hatte ich eine Geschmacksexplosion erwartet, die einen sofort und für immer umhaut. Nichts dergleichen. Das Quadrupel kommt dezent mit Pflaume, Likär, Beeren, Vanille, Zartbitterschokolade und leichtem Karamell rüber. Dabei ist das Bier leicht süß aber gerade noch so, dass es richtig männlich ist. Bestimmt bekomme ich für den Kommentar wieder Haßposts. Ich erahne noch weitere Aromen, möchte sie aber aus Unsicherheit nicht benennen. Zweite Verkostung nötig. Ich habe gar nicht gemerkt, dass das Bier schon fast leer ist, deshalb nun der Abgang: Der Alkohol gewinnt an Dominanz und bringt zusammen mit der Hopfung eine merkliche und sehr gut abgestimmte Bitterkeit ins Spiel. So können die vorher genannten Aromen, die immer noch da sind, in einem anderen Licht erlebt werden. Absolut phantastisch gelöst. Garantiert ist das das beste Quadrupel, das ich je getrunken habe. Zu dem besten Bier: ich glaube nicht, dass dieses Bier in Kuba am Strand bei 34 Grad das beste ist oder es einem Radler Liebhaber gefallen würde. Deshalb ist der Begriff für mich auch lächerlich und für jeden Betrachter anders. Ich finde es auch nicht nachvollziehbar für so ein Meisterwerk 3 Sterne zu vergeben, aber so sind eben die unterschiedlichen Geschmäcker.

Westvleteren 12,"Bottle from a crate ordered at the abbey. Bottled: 27/04/2022. Consumed: 06/2022 - hardly two months old. Finally, the world-famous Westvleteren XII has made it to my home and what better way to add my rating than with a young example? Obviously, I'm looking forward to drinking aged examples in the coming years...
Pours a hazy dark amber to brown with a stable, foamy, tan head. Very expressive aroma of tawny port, red wine, wood, red apple slices, dried banana, pear, overripe blue plum, brown bread, baker's yeast, artisan milk chocolate, chestnut. Taste has a sweet estery mix of blue plum, red apple, dried banana & raisin in a thick brown-bready, slightly toasty, somewhat chocolatey malt body with a hint of candi sugar, but never in a cloying way, surrounded by a spicy and a dry-yeasty note, and even a sourish dark-fruity streak. The herbal & peppery hoppy finish offers more dried & candied fruits, spices and 'dry' brown bread and even a very vague hint of coffee. The whole is topped off with a noble, vinous warmth of brandy-like alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy-moussy texture, average carbonation (toning down when warming up). Evidently, it's hard to approach this beer unbiasedly, but its powerful character slowly but surely reveals itself, leaving you without a doubt that it's a masterpiece.",4.5,0.98

The ABV carries the taste nicely and is not felt at all.

Westvleteren 12,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",4.4,0.9887

Opaque and dark brown with lots of yeast sediments. Deep, earthy, and sweet aroma with clear notes of nuts and figs, finishing with vinous alcohol. Intense, incredibly deep and complex taste. Starts off with slight notes of citrus, rounding over in figs, nuts, honey, cocoa, slight coffee. This is followed by a slight bitterness before it ends in chocolaty feel. Full-bodied oily texture and very foamy. An incredible experience. The people who claim that Sint Bernardus Abt 12 is like this beer are incredulous, for lack of better word. Beats that firmly, and even edges out my old favourite: Trappistes Rochefort 10.

Westvleteren 12,"Bevuta con particolare emozione sapendo dell'unicità dell'esperienza. Bottiglia in edizione speciale XII, BB 02/12/2014, dunque imbottigliata nel dicembre 2009. Invecchiata per quasi 12 anni. Schiuma praticamente assente, colore marrone scuro non torbido ma con molti lieviti sospesi anche al primo colpo. Carbonazione leggera. Al naso enorme complessità, su tutto caramello, frutta secca e di bosco, sentori erbacei. In bocca leggermente acquosa ma allo stesso tempo di buon corpo. Caramello e i tipici derivati dell'ossidazione dominano la bevuta, la frutta rimane sullo sfondo. Arriva poi uno delizioso amaro che porta diverse pennellate erbacee e floreali, accentuando anche il resto dei sentori. Finale dolce ma secco, che assume anche una nota acida e tostata quando la birra sale di temperatura, oltre a un pelo di liquirizia. La transizione tra amaro e il finale è il più grande pregio di questa birra.

Het is wel de cultstatus die er mede aan bijdraagt dat dit bier door elke bierliefhebber zeker een keer gedronken moet zijn, gelul natuurlijk...mensen die niet van het type Quadruppel houden gaan dit ook niet lekker vinden omdat het Westvleteren is, en de verkrijgbaarheid is nog steeds RUK.

B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"#800! Bottle at the Colorado Mead Tasting ’12. Pour is deep, purple, crimson with no head. Looks like a glass full of blood; beautiful. The aroma is euphoric with deep wood notes, black currants, red grapes, blackberries, sweet tarts, raspberries, and tart cherries. Taste is smooth from beginning to end; sweet dark fruits, cranberry juice, red grapes, blackberries, dark raisins, a hint of vanilla, cocoa, and wood. Syrupy mouthfeel with no carbonation. Not overly sweet, and the acid balances out the sweetness so beautifully, something I could drink all night long.

Looked quite thick in the glass, and like a serious drink.  Aroma is huge, Super ripe cherry hits me first, maybe one of the best cherry aromas I have ever smelled, I pictured dark black cherries, you definitely get currants and berries as well and some sweet dark  honey.  Taste delivers on the aroma huge cherry again, quite a bit of tartness as well from the berries, like a raspberry tartness, tons and tons of red fruit, there is just so much fruit in this thing, on the back end you remember that this is a mead, as the big dark sweet honey kicks in to balance some of the fruit tartness, long finish and a residual sweetness in the back of you mouth, as the tart berries settles on your tongue.  At some point you forget exactly what you are drinking and that there is alcohol involved, as the drink is so interesting and fun.

First off, it is blood red in color and pours like blood coming from your hand into a glass. It really has that look and feel of blood. Taste was on another level. You can taste raspberries and cherries, but the black currants were the strongest flavor. Im not sure if it was the honey or something else, but I got a little bit of cinnamon in the mouth.

B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"bottle # 24/110
Perfect fit for rating # 3000. A very special bottle indeed. First because it was offered to me as a present for my graduation by Greg, Askofficerfriendly and his wife. Second, a celebration of my bday and return to Belgium, and third, probably the first B.Nektar mead to make it to Europe and one of my favorite US meadery.
This one goes out to you Greg/Bridget and the good folks at B.Nektar!

Pours a deep burgundy with an outstanding clear syrupy filament/coating on the glass.
The aroma brings this mead to another level by the depth of the fruits being used. One can easily pick a medley of currants, raspberries and cherries where one scent leaves room to another never to overtake the experience.
Perfect bouquet of honey follows adding this ever enjoyable organic natural fragrance.
The mouthfeel is similar to the aroma and a bouquet of orchard brings fantastic dimensions to the mead. Great blend between the fruits leaving room for each cherry, raspberries and currants to be noticed.  The honey adds a great balance to the acidity of the fruits that although not overpowering was enough to give me a nice heartburn quickly following the first glass (a first with all B.Nektar) and that was the low point of the whole experience. The honey also leaves a mild sweet syrupy sticky finish on the lips that is very enjoyable.

Overall a great mead that I thoroughly enjoyed in good company of family.",4.3,0.9962

Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a dark blood/beet red color that’s almost purple with a one finger pink foam head that quickly settles into a thin ring.  Minimal lacing left behind.  Definitely a unique looking beer.  Don’t see many that have that color.

The aroma is bursting with sweet tropical fruit.  I’m not very familiar with either of these fruits but the tropical fruit presence dominates the nose.  Slightly seedy with a decent amount of funk but the aroma is all about the dragonfruit/passionfruit.  Could use a bit more funk/traditional berlinerweisse character but still smells really good.

Medium bodied with a nice balance of tart funkiness and sweet tropical fruit.  More balanced than the nose suggests with some lactic funk, acidity and bready yeast but it’s still dominated by sweet, juicy fruit notes.  Very sweet but with enough acidity and funk to keep it from becoming one dimensional.  Very refreshing with a crisp dry finish.  A lot of people went apeshit over this beer and while I think that’s it’s really good, it didn’t completely blow me away.  I  actually preferred the Miami Madness over this one.",4.1,0.9741

The tart fruit notes blend harmoniously with the traditional flavors of this invigorating German wheat beer.  As the day heated up, CC released this ruby masterpiece just in time to cool off the overheated crowd.  A brilliant change of pace from the heavy lumbering stouts.  The crowd was whipped up into a frenzy by this tie-dye gem sauntering throughout the festival, and the keg blew within the hour.....",4.5,0.9805
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"A: Poured an electric color of magenta, sorta the bright color of pink that kids create by putting a highlighter in water to spice up liquor bottles in a dorm room. Small fizzy head with no retention. The sight of the beer alone sent people to the tap in droves. S: The aroma was bold and citric. Fresh fruity undertones with hints of acidic sharpness. T: The color may have sent people running it was the flavor that brought them back. The beer was awesome simply put. Nice sharp tartness right up front. Slighty citric, my guess this was provided by the dragon fruit After the initial blast of tartness it actually smooths out real nicely. A nice mild sweetness comes through almost guava like which I will attribute to the passion fruit. A Yin and Yang of a beer, tart, sweet, awesome, and stunningly beautiful. M: Medium in body starts tart finishes sweeter with only a mild acidic character. D: Awesome. It is one I would have revisited all day. Too bad everyone else had the same idea and it lasted a whole 10 min or so on draft. Cheers JW it rocked!",4.8,0.9924
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"On tap at CCB’s Huna day 2011.

The color on this thing just screams dragon-fruit. It was my second beer of the day the first being a breakfast glass of 4 Roses BB Zhukov so this was a wake up call.

Aroma was all passion for me and strawberry jolly ranchers??!

Taste was serious business dragon fruit/passion fruit and yes strawberry jolly ranchers was a great description. It made me smack my chops three or four times after each sip and it made my mouth water for more.  The Tartness was spot on as it didn’t over power but caught you right at the tip of the tongue then made way for all the fruity goodness.

Great work J-Dub!!",5.0,0.963

Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"On tap at Hunah 2011! This beer was, hands down, one of the days major show-stealers. The minute the beer is poured into the glass, your  attention is brought into focus, the color is a translucent blood-ruby with a pink ""weisse"" head. The aroma is a sweet fruit  pungency and tartness, nose-full of passion fruit and some hints of the dragon fruit follows suit.  Palate starts with some tart passion fruit which quickly leads into the traditional, berliner weisse refreshing wheat tartness. Sweet fruit melds into the background and the backpalate is then left with a clean citrus finish. Excellent beer!",4.6,0.9583
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"Tap at Hunahpu 2011. Everyone was carrying around the festival something that looked like Kool-aid burst so I decided to find out what it was. Lo and behold, Dragon Passionfruit Berliner Weisse. The pour is a hilariously deep, clear pink with a nice, fizzy pink head. Looks like a fruit juice spritzer. Aroma is heavy seedy raspberries, odd phenol character. Taste is heavy berry tannic, fully tart like a passionfruit smoothie. Some people at the festival claimed it wasn’t very tart, which is incorrect. Very refreshing and nicely done. Definitely something to pursue for the normal CCB lineup- bound to be the most loved beer in the world by women in their 20s. If you want more girls getting into good beer, this is the winning ticket. 3/14/2011 7/4/7/4/14=3.6

Tap at Berliner Bash thanks to JW77. Gorgeous purple pink pour. Full haze. Creamy and glowing. Whoa. Nose is super intense rhubarb/strawberry, dragonfruit, fresh mango. Taste is very nice- super seedy, sharp and zippy, loads of acid, small wheat beer graininess remains. Very nice. Heavy citric acid. Zippy, lactic yogurty palate.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 3/3/2012.
Inky black and viscous looking. A vigorous pour yields only a slight chocolate head. No retention to speak of.

Smells wonderful. Bourbon, but so well integrated. It’s not a bourbon bomb like regular BCBS. Vanilla and oak blend seamlessly with the chocolate stout flavors. Far less boozy than regular BCBS. Even less boozy than Big John.

Initial tingly bourbon flavor followed by vanilla and caramel malts. The flavor fades to a darker malt roast of chocolate and coffee. Very sweet, but almost forgivable given the flavors at play. The sweetness gives it a slightly fruity flavor that complements the roast nicely. Like chocolate covered cherries.

Regular BCBS tastes like it’s 20% alcohol. This tastes nowhere near 13%. It’s amazing how dramatically it changes the beer. Still immensely sweet and a slow drink. Thick, viscous, and low in carbonation.

It’s a really good stout. Much better than BCBS. Worth the money? Probably not.

Update: Drank my last bottle on 10/3/2016 side-by-side with 2015 Rare and there was no comparison. 2010 was still drinking great and was a far better beer than 2010.",4.4,0.9967

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"Bottle #1448

Pours viscous, pitch black and completely opaque with a half finger mocha head that immediately disappears. No lacing left behind but it does have lasting legs that coat the glass in a muddy film. 

Barrel character is really strong in the nose but it seems nicely integrated into aroma. Lots of spicy bourbon but it’s not overpowering with dry oak, toasted coconut and vanilla bean notes. Sweet, slightly roasted malt backbone with sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, coffee bean, baker’s chocolate and subtle roast/burnt malt. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with subtle viscosity and an excellent barrel character that’s perfectly integrated into the base beer. Spicy bourbon barrel with toasted coconut, marshmallow, vanilla and a wonderful spicy PVW flavor. Subtle boozy heat but not fiery, harsh or overpowering. Tastes just like the spirit without obliterating the base beer. Sure, there’s some sweet booze and heat lingering throughout but the other barrel notes and malt backbone counter things nicely. Fudge-y chocolate goodness with fudge, caramel, molasses and toffee give it a sweet and dessert like quality but it’s not one-note. There’s some roast with hints of dark chocolate, roasted gourmet coffee bean, burnt toast and oatmeal. The high ABV is extremely well masked making this delicious, complex beer dangerously drinkable. The flavor of this beer is close to perfect.",4.4,0.9976

The pour is a thick, viscous, oily black with a medium brown collar of head. The aroma is phenomenal. Heavy roasted malts and chocolate to go along with a wonderful bourbon complexity. This is probably the best smelling bourbon barrel character I’ve ever picked up in a beer. There is a lot of dark fruit and a little toffee in there. The flavors mimic it as well. The only thing that pails is there is a light lack of vanilla in the aroma. This is detectable in the flavor, and I love it.

Aroma: Tons of chocolate on the nose followed by powerful scent of bourbon.
Taste: What I picked up on the nose gets amplified on the palate. Starts with big chocolate and then the rich bourbon flavor starts to build and come into its own. This is such an excellent fusion of flavor.
Palate: Medium body. Beer leaves its mark on your palate and the flavors persist long after a sip.
Overall: This was one of the finest imp. stouts I have ever had. I wish I had a more sophisticated bourbon palate to better detect the intricacies of the barrel aging. Regardless, this was like eating a box of chocolates, all of which were filled with pappy!",4.6,0.9697

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Batch 2 750ml bottle.  Pours a pitch black color that looks like thick motor oil and capped by a small tan layer of foam that shows good retention before settling into a thin film. Looks as menacing as ever like Hunaphu’s always did.  The aroma shows notes of dark chocolate, cinnamon, toasted nuts, and earthy chili peppers over a very dark roasted malt base with hints of old oak, and spicy rum notes.  I’m not getting much from the Apple brandy barrel.  The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon up front and backed up by the earthy chili peppers that adds some heat on the back end. The barrel presence is minimal and there is some oxidation from the age, but the alcohol is fairly restrained.  Full bodied and fairly smooth with subtle carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy chili peppers on the finish with some lingering notes of rum and oak.  Interesting enough for sure and the Huna are all still there but the barrels don’t really bring everything together like I was hoping for and the barrel expression isn’t quite as pronounced as I would like.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Cigar City Brewing - Double Barrel Hunahpu’s 2016

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alkohol: 11% obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy rozwścieczonego boga ognia Hun-Hunaphu

Piana: Beżowa, skromna o drobno ziarnistej strukturze. 
Głośno syczy i opada do niewielkiego paseczka. Na krawędziach TeKu pozostają punktowe plamki. 

Zapach: Jest miazga! Aromat rozpieprza na maksa. Na początek rum i rodzynki macerowane w tym szlachetnym trunku. Potem cała gamma suszonych owoców, kandyzowane jabłka, śliwki, morele i winogrona.
Zaraz po tym potworny cios prosto w twarz od ziaren kakaowca, gęstej mlecznej czekolady i belgijskich pralin. 
Knock out zapewnia szereg elementów toffi, kawy, rodzynek, cukru trzcinowego i przypraw korzennych.
Przepiękny bukiet!

Smak: Niewiarygodny beczkowy profil. Euforię smaków rozpoczyna szlachetny rum o jego mocnym i bezkompromisowym smaku, pełnym przypaw korzennych i drewna. Następnie wkracza z wielką werwą beczka po jabłkowej Brandy (czyli jak domniemam po Calvadosie) nadając trunkowi posmak pieczonej szarlotki.
Kolejne warstwy bukietu smaków to lawina czekolady, toffi, pralin belgijskich, trzciny cukrowej, drewna, rodzynek i toffi.
Ostatnia prosta należy z całą pewnością do przypraw z których najbardziej wyróżnia się chilli, stawiając kropeczkę nad „i”, poszczypując w gardle. 
Alkohol jest obecny, rozgrzewa, trochę mąci w głowie, ale na szczęście nie ma ciepłego, rozpuszczalnikowego charakteru i nie wychodzi przed szereg.
Ciała Double Barrel Hunaphu’s nie brakuje.
Dostojny, szlachetny charakter trunku zapewni wiele minut udanej, owocnej degustacji.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

Nareszcie!! Hunahpu’s (kilka roczników) - NIE! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NIE!
I dopiero Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - zdecydowanie TAK! 

Przecudowne piweczko dające tyle radości i satysfakcji z degustacji!
Głęboki profil smakowy i zapachowy, oszałamiające beczki po Rumie i Calvadosie.
Balans, głębia, różnorodność, klasa i szyk.

Najlepsze piwo w dorobku Cigar City Brewing!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Tasted against regular 16 Huna and 17 Bourbon BA Huna. Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy.

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"On tap in Madison, WI

Toppling Goliath has a reputation for excellence which made this the main draw for a night out at one of Madison's best bars. Worth every penny of the cost, it delivers an experience unrivalled by all but the best of the best. Despite the lines I may have to make a detour to their booth at the Great Taste this year to get another pour.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A deep oily black core permeates the glass and stains everything it touches. A minimal head tracks the long icy legs which melt like sheets of snow on a warm spring day. Plums, raspberry, anise, and coffee hang in the air with a glowing warmth that feels mellow and dense. There's no mistaking the ABV but even so it feels very approachable.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Warm espresso, dark chocolate, plums, and blackberries coat the palate with layers of boozy sediment. The dense flavors complement each other so well that it is nearly effortless to follow each sip with another. The mildly bitter finish continues to warm the throat well after the glass is empty. Overall there is only one complaint - that I did not order a full pour when offered the opportunity.",4.6,0.9916

Imperial Stout with Neapolitan ice cream treatment.

Zapach: W aromacie jest prawdziwa magia! Inspiracja lodami Neapolitan, jak najbardziej trafiona w punkt. Tak jak na zamieszczonym na etykiecie obrazku - warstwy piwa rozkładają się dokładnie w ten sam sposób. Najpierw dogłębna, najlepszej jakości szwajcarska czekolada, wraz z nią kakao i melasa. Potem nie mniej intensywna wanilia, słodka deserowa, stanowiąca trzon centralny trunku.
Na koniec jogurt truskawkowy, lody z kawałkami truskawek i shake o tym samym smaku. Wszystkie 3 poziomy wzajemnie przenikają przez siebie tworząc spójną całość.

Smak: Smak na prawdę odbiera mowę. Najpiękniejszy i najpyszniejszy deser na świecie. 
Płynna czekolada z domieszkami orzechów migdałowych, leciutka kawa, melasa i ziarna kakaowca.
Od groma ciasteczek waniliowych i lodów.
Truskawka gdzieś tam się przewija. Nie ma najmniejszego problemu z wyłapaniem jej pomiędzy poszczególnymi. warstwami.
Tekstura gęsta i oleista. Brak nut alkoholowych.

Cycle / 3 Sons Rare Scooop,"(From notes): Bottle shared at a friend’s birthday shindig. Pours jet black with almost no head. The lovely scents of strawberries/vanilla/chocolate all waft up from the snifter along with a tiny bit of roast malt. While still nice, the strawberry aroma is a touch artificial when compared with the rest of the nose. Holy cavity, Batman! -- an intense, nearly overpowering sweetness dominates the flavor before the same Neapolitan blend makes its presence known.

There is a huge Neapolitan ice cream happening, with a big fudgness and a sweet molasses. It’s unbelievably complex. Everything just balances so well. The mouth feel is the incredible levels that 3 Sons imparts on their stouts. There is a heavy thickness that almost requires chewing.

Overall: I'm a big fan of sherry, however sherry matured Zenne y Frontera always frustrated me. For B5 I got typical Fino characters instead of Oloroso and PX, however it's still enjoyable, anyway. Unfortunately, the prestigious B1 disappointed me. It's very unlike lambic to be so spicy on nose while openning, meanwhile the sherry infulences(I was expecting tons of dried fruits, nuts and coffee chocolate characters from those 40 year old Oloroso and PX sherry casks) were still hard to identify, despite the spiceness could be recognized as Oloroso. It's quite decent on mouth in absolute terms, however inappropriate to it's price and championship nowadays. The bottle looks well kept, so I wonder why this was such overhyped.
我是个雪莉发烧友，但过雪莉桶的ZF系列一直让我很困惑。比如说B5我尝到的是Fino而不是Oloroso和PX，但再怎么说，它也还算愉悦。不幸的是，这支盛名在外的B1让我失望了。刚开瓶时如此抢戏的香料让此酒闻起来很不兰比克，与此同时雪莉风味依旧难以辨认（我原本期待着来自桶陈40年Oloroso和PX雪莉的海量坚果、咖啡和巧克力风味），虽说那些香料味可以被当作是来自Oloroso雪莉。从绝对意义上说，这酒喝起来还真不错，但显然跟它如今高高在上的价格与地位有些不匹配。这一瓶的保存状态看上去相当好，这就让我很好奇这款酒是怎么被吹到这种程度的。

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"Well, here is then, a new 3F legend, bottle bought from a private collector - for a crazy price, but I could not resist. Shared with Jan of Weerspannige Brouwers. Medium thick, moussy, densely packed, pale yellowish white, lightly lacing, very stable head over a misty peach blonde beer with light orange hue. Complex and extremely elegant bouquet of gooseberry, unripe melon, lime juice, fermenting hay, wet wood, dry sherry indeed but well integrated into the whole, cava, moldy lemon peel, slight vanilla (oak?), unripe pear, mandarin peel, yoghurt, stale sweat but subtly so, passion fruit. Rich estery onset full of gooseberry, redcurrant, unripe plum and passion fruit, tart with a sweetish edge somewhere, champagne-like carbonation just fit for the style; soft lemony acidity (’mals’) and sedate lactic sourishness dominate the whole and dry the palate but again in an extremely elegant, ’friendly’ and softish kind of way, over a backbone of bready barley and soapy, deeply sourish wheat. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, more ’moelleux’ than usual for a geuze. Passion fruit and gooseberry tartness persist towards the finish, pairing up with a brief but well-placed earthy ’old’ hop bitterish touch and drying, noble woodiness, bearing a sherry accent which blends in perfectly with the natural oloroso-like features of the lambic; a genuine sherry flavor subtly lingers in the back of the mouth after swallowing while the soft lambic tartness persists. A very subtle vanilla-like sweetish accent pops up too distinguishing this from other geuzes, along with the subtle sherry accent. In all, however, this sherry factor is just a touch of colour, rather than a dominant flavor imposed on it - I can easily see how this got its reputation and raving scores here. This is among the most elegant, noble and ’aristocratic’ lambic beers I ever had the pleasure to taste, it really doesn’t get much better than this. What a masterpiece... I’m even inclined to purchase another bottle for the same price and keep it in the cellar for some years. The perfect geuze, perhaps?",4.8,0.9976

Podsumowanie:

Długo poszukiwałem Bourbon Dark Lord’a w USA. Przemierzałem bezkresne tereny amerykańskich prerii, pustyń, lasów, jezior i oceanów, aby nareszcie odnaleźć swój mały „piwny gral”.

Cieszę się, że to akurat wersje z 2017 udało mi się zdobyć.
Podstawka z tego właśnie roku zrobiła na mnie kolosalne wrażenie. 
Beczka po bourbonie, a raczej blend różnych beczek po bourbonie (m.in. Woodford Reserve i Heaven Hill) wyniosła ten trunek na niesamowicie wysoki poziom. Intensywność beczkowej wanilii oraz kokosu jest niebywała.
Różnorodność składowych to kolejny pierwszorzędny atut tego trunku.
„Cukry Florydy” mogą się mierzyć ze słodyczą tego trunku.
#teamsłodyczka, a raczej #teamcukrzyca w pełnej krasie.
Dla mnie absolutny wymiatacz!",4.8,-0.9483

Sour flavor still has ton of tons of fruit, incredible depth, slightly bitter arsenic/rubber that grows with warmth, high co2 bitterness, acidity high but soft and supremely jammy through the lightly watery finish, would prefer a stickier end but this is absolutely delicious.

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"500 ml bottle


What better beer to celebrate someone’s birthday and another milestone (2900 ratings) than a new rating from the mind of Dan Carey? A world class sour beer, I am glad I have another tucked away in the cellar. It has held up well this last year though if you have any reason at all to crack it open with friends then enjoy this before the next one hits in a few weeks.



Aroma / Appearance - A deep ruby red base sticks to the glass with little effort. Flat with no obvious carbonation this has the vibe of an aged lambic. Blackberries, aggressive vinegar, and other acidic aspects are almost as sharp as a bottle of vintage La Folie. Despite that the fruitiness keeps it from being just a sour bottle of salad dressing.



Flavor / Palate - Blackberry syrup and vinegar poured over a fresh pie fills the mouth with a chewy texture. Not content to just scour the palate clean it then lingers in the throat like an army of scrubbing bubbles leaving a sour mark behind. There are no flaws to be found with this except that the bottle is only 500 ml. Once again New Glarus has proven that they are seldom mistaken with a recipe. I can’t wait to try the 2014 sour in just a few weeks.",4.5,0.9666

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"3 oz pour at bottle share, thanks Shea!
Appearance: Light foam which left slight trails around the glass. Dark purple coloration reminiscent of blackberry juice. Very inviting.
Aroma: Wow. One of the most aromatic beers I have ever enjoyed. Big blackberry aroma wafts out of the glass. There’s no synthetic smell here, its as if hundreds of blackberries were freshly squeezed and jammed into the bottle!
Taste: The flavor progression on this sour is both amazing and surprising. You get an obscenely fresh blackberry flavor on the front while the tartness builds through the middle and climaxes on the finish. In contrast, many sours which I have had blast you with sour on the start and give the fruit flavor on the finish. The sour finish is fairly intense, reminiscent of warhead candy. This flavor is so fresh and spot on I actually had the sensation of phantom blackberry seeds!
Palate: Medium body, very effervescent, bubbly all the way down the palate.
Overall: This is hands down my favorite sour that I have ever had. I was heartbroken when I reached the end of my pour. I just kept breathing in the (still extremely pungent!) aroma from the last vestiges of this sweet nectar of the gods. Well done New Glarus, well done.",4.9,0.9839

My first impression is that this tastes a *lot* like Pliny the Elder with more bitterness in the finish.  It looks like that beer with a clear light amber body but almost no head at all.  The bitterness has some citrus rind but it's quite vegetal in nature although not overpowering like some IPAs.  It reminds me a bit of the hop flavor in Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum.   Good balancing sweetness and it's very drinkable at 10.25% ABV.  The hops really dig in all the way around the tongue and stay put long after the sip is over.  A great ""triple"" IPA that I would definitely make an effort to try again, but I wouldn't go through some of the ridiculous efforts that I've heard others have to go through to get it.",4.2,0.8828

Overall
It is said that this was a QDH TIPA. There were signs which suggested that this beer was a hugely improved version of DDH PTE - sweetness, floral, corn, ripe fruits, refreshing bitterness, etc. The improvement is mainly about the mouthfeel - such thick and creamy, without any peppery pungency. This beer is extremely easy drinking and enjoyable, especially for sweet enthusiasts.  A redefinition of West Coast IPA!
据说这是款四倍干投的三倍IPA。有一些迹象表明这款酒是DDH PTE的魔改版——可以感受到甜度、花香、玉米味、成熟的果味还有清爽的苦度等一脉相承的特征。改进之处主要在于口感，如此的厚重而又细腻，没有丝毫的椒麻感。这款酒极其的易饮且愉悦，尤其是对于甜渣党而言。它重新定义了西海岸IPA！

Po raz pierwszy wypuszczone już w 2005 roku!
Piwo do zeszłego roku było dostępne tylko i wyłącznie lane w browarze w Santa Rosa, jeden jedyny dzień w roku, w lutym. Długie kolejki beer geeków wyczekiwały godzinami na możliwość spróbowania tego majstersztyku.
W zeszłym i w tym roku właściciele browaru, małżeństwo Natalie i Vinnie Cilurzo zdecydowali się zabutelkować Pliniusza. 
W 2021 roku do szerokiej palety chmieli dołączył nowy chmiel - Elixir. 

Pliniusz Młodszy nalewa się z białą, puszystą jak śnieg pianą, która powolutku osuwa się w dół zostawiając umiarkowanej ilości krążki.
Kolorek złoty, czysty, klarowny.
Już po zdjęciu brandowanej czapeczki czuć siłę i intensywność chmielu. Pachnie fenomenalnie - żywica, igiełki sosnowe, las, lawina cytrusów, z których najmocniej wyczuwalne są pomarańcze i mandarynki. Przyjemna słodowość, a zaraz za nią minimalne kwiatowe nutki. Po ogrzaniu w dłoniach jeszcze więcej żywicznych detali. 
Smak bucha intensywnością, a zarazem zaskakuje lekkością i gładkością doznań.
Intensywnie iglasty, leśny z elementami igiełek sosnowych. Potęga cytrusów: mandarynek, grejpfrutów, pomarańczy przypieczętowana elementami ananasa. Goryczka konkretna, ale w żadnym stopniu nie  przytłaczająca.
Arcymistrzowski balans. Ciało potężne i zbite. Raz goryczkowe, raz słodkie, raz cytrusowe, raz kwiatowe, raz żywiczne. Całość połączona w niezapomniany obrazek. 
Doskonałe, niezapomniane doświadczenie. 
Hype is real!😍🤩🔥💥🍻",4.7,-0.9229

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Arguably the most sought-after IPA in the world, the almost mythical offspring of Russian River's legendary Pliny the Elder, created in 2005 as a superlative to the Elder in a sense - effectively creating 'triple IPA' as a genre, even if double IPA and triple IPA are obviously a continuum and both are regarded as one single category on this site.  Hopped with Amarillo, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and more - a complete line-up of famed New World hop varieties, in other words.  Originally released as a winter seasonal and so far only made available from tap in the two tasting rooms of the brewery each year in February, but thank the beer gods that the Cilurzos decided to try and bottle it this year - enabling it to travel, with so far one single bottle having reached Belgium, a bottle I was very honoured to get a sample of.  If, among all those famous and top class American masterpieces, there was one I never thought I could ever taste, it's this one - so I cannot thank Bart enough for inviting me to the tasting of this celebrity.  Medium thick, snow white, mousy, opening head with a waferthin, disparate 'veil' of foam left in the middle; equally hazy bright yellow golden robe.  Vibrant, colourful, zesty and slightly dank aroma of drying orange peel, green olives, lime zest, gin, orange water, freshly cut green onions, unripe mango, raw pineapple, dough, peanut oil, yellow grapefruit.  Clean but bright and intense fruitiness hinting at unripe mango, green banana and hard pear, lively carbonated though nowhere harshly so; full, smooth-edged, oily body.  A rounded, clean white-bready maltiness is soaked in aromatic, yet well-contained hoppiness, pineapple-ish and (green-) oniony, but most of all very zesty (lime, pomelo), providing long lingering 'green and yellow' aromas as well as a long-stretched, but refined peppery bitterness, highlighted by a gin-like alcohol warmth - and topped with an ever so subtle sweaty note (frying shallot).  This is about as radiant, refined, wonderfully balanced and at the same time expressive and powerful IPA gets: a truly fantastic beer and a standard in IPA in general indeed, even if the hazy New England idiom has meanwhile taken over the larger part of it.  I feel humbled by this kind of perfection - for me, having initially developed a taste for West Coast boldness, this masterpiece is very much worth the hype, though I also have to add that I would probably not wait for eight hours in line for two bottles, like many people in California apparently did a few weeks ago when this was released.  That said, I have no idea how IPA can be made any more beguiling, beautiful, radiant, balanced and intelligent; I cannot immediately think of a better one I had and at this level of 'mythical status', scores seem rather petty - so heck, have a near perfect score as far as I'm concerned, you deserve it.  Considering how bottles are already sold on the second hand market for hundreds of dollars, the very reason why the brewery never wanted to bottle this beer in the first place, it remains doubtful if this 'experiment' of bottling Pliny the Younger will be repeated next year - so for the time being, I'll consider this a once in a lifetime opportunity, which obviously adds to the experience and, I admit it, to my personal appreciation.",4.7,0.999

Taste is strong grapefruit, pine, lighter tropical fruit and citrus. Palate is medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, soft carbonation and fairly dry, crisp finish as taste, dominated by a pleasant grapefruit/piney bitterness. Overall, very, very nice. Bold aroma and flavor but not quite as complex as Elder. It's no wonder these two have received the iconic status they have, given how long they have been around (Elder added '01, Younger '05). They still stand up and obviously paved the way for more flavorful, juicy IPA's but must have been truly revolutionary back in the day.",4.3,0.8755

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"Maybe it's that I've sampled a few different TIPAs of varying quality over the past few weeks, maybe it's that I've been sitting in my basement in southeast Tennessee sipping Younger and feeling extra special, but goddamn if this beer isn't the platonic ideal of what a massive, gargantuan India Pale Ale should be. Enormous amounts of citrus on the nose, yet the fruit only forms part of the taste, instead allowing plenty of room for deep, herbaceous pine and hints of berry and resin, with a modest but sturdy malt backbone and clingy bitterness on the finish. Amazing. Balanced, full, and gentle despite the whopping ABV. So friggin' good.",4.7,0.6697

Overall
The beer came as a complete surprise to me. It's more of an old bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout, or even Barleywine and Shaoxingwine, instead of a young Pastry Stout... With almost insanely salty, soy sauce-y and plumy, it reminds me of Goose Island Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout 2014. No trace of common vanilla adjuncts (but it seems that vanilla beans can also have prune-like smell?), neither do marshmallow. Exactly match my palate, however I was expecting something totally different from this bottle. Hard to rate such...
这款酒完全出乎我的意料。它很像一款老年份的过桶帝国世涛，甚至大麦或者绍兴酒，就是不像年轻的甜世涛。。。如此疯狂的咸度、酱油味和话梅味，让我想起鹅岛的Proprietor's BCBS 2014。没有别的酒里常见的那种香草增味（但据说香草荚本身是带有西梅干味的？），也没有棉花糖。别说还真的特别合我的胃口，但问题是我开瓶之前期待的是完全不同的东西啊。给这种酒打分真是头疼。。。

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Served at the Mikkeller Bar in Copenhagen during a tap takeover a few years back. The line stretched out the door. Pitty the fools that thought it best to start light and finish with this bad boy, only to be disappointed the keg had kicked after 20 or 30 minutes. This one share the same black pour and tan head as the other Dark Lords, and also the basic flavor profile. The extra vanilla kick is what sets this one apart. Incredibly delicious.",4.4,-0.0083
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Massing thanks to Compton25! Obtained in a trade. This one has been an absolute top want of mine since I got into beer, I managed (or thanks to the kindness of others I manged) to try almost every dream beer since then. This one kept eluding & I am the only one since basically almost everyone but seem to have tried this one. I have had several version of Dark Lord since then including the bourbon one in 2013 (perfection) & in 2015 or so, disappointment (too soy sauce / messy). I realize that people hate on these beers, I adored many BA version, I actually thought that the regular one was fair way back in 2012 but apparently it has been going downhill ever since or that is just perception. Anyway sparkling green wax, waxing is so old school now, modern Dark Lord special label. Pours black, head is amazing very deep, deepest coffee but sadly doesn’t last. No head very quickly. Nose is old school RIS syrup, pure molasses, treacle, syrup, so sweet thick syrupy with bourbon, candlewax vanilla mixed in, maple, insanely sweet molasses RIS syrup. Taste is chocolate desert pudding molasses, felts crazy strong pure sugar, maple, treacle, dark honey, bourbon concentrate syrup sugar, candy, butterscotch, unbelievably thick, syrupy & sweet,… Vanilla is not as big as hoped. Pure syrup, soft carbonation. Once you get into some ultra-sweet coffee in the back, melted chocolate. Pure insane sweet syrup, this kids is how rare special BA stouts used to taste like, even sweeter. Crazy sweet but tasty brew, pure candy syrup and sugar. Worked great with Thai food, it could bear the spices, strong flavours etc. Fight fire with fire.",4.6,0.9889

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2013. TotalCaos getting this! Everyone is just flocking the Three Floyds stand. Anyhow, the first thin noticed is that is has no head. Swirling the glass does not help much either, and it’s really dark and black in the glass. Lovely aroma of, yeah you guessed it, VANILLA. Sweet and tons of it. Dark sweet chocolate also, and it’s heavy roasted. The sweetness and the vanilla us what sticks in this. Smooth! Oh, my.. As smooth as smooth gets, and the vanilla is just out of this world. Almost like my Créme Brûlée only liquefied and added tons of strong sweet chocolate. What a lovely flavor. It’s a bit far out there on the sweet side, but it’s something about that vanilla that’s just like heaven. Ends light dry with a lingering chocolaty aftertaste that’s again filled with vanilla and a little bit of mouthdrying wood. World class! 04.05.2013",4.0,0.9705

Deep sweet chocolate notes, deep fudge, molasses, intense vanilla, Liquid marshmallows, sweet campfire bourbon, intense sweet fudge finish. So delicious.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kelly’s Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle. 2016 vintage. Holy hell, I never thought I’d get to try one of these! The pour is a jet black motor oil with a thin ring of brown head that dissipates. This looks like a tar pit. The aroma is heavy on the dark chocolate, sweet molasses, light bourbon, and bitter roast. The vanilla isn’t’ as heavy as I would’ve liked it on the nose. The alcohol is a little heavy on the finish. The flavor has a little more vanilla in it, but some of the other flavors intensify as well. The chocolate and molasses really explode. The bourbon takes on a thing of its own. The barrel even offers a little more. It’s complex, good, complete, but the vanilla isn’t as prominent as it should be. The mouth feel is thick and chewy with a soft carbonation and a bright vanilla on the aftertaste. The chocolate, bourbon, and maltiness are there, but the vanilla really comes through here. It’s by far the best Dark Lord anything I’ve had to date. This is a beautiful beer.",4.3,0.9832
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Shared bottle. Not much in a way of appearance - dark brown thick liquid with virtually no foam, something you would expect from such a big beer. Rich and complex aroma dominated by vanilla and bourbon over the black chocolate and coffee notes common to imperial stouts in general. Tastes as complex as it smells, with vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel and coffee nuances playing in tandem and changing one another with every moment passing since the first sip. A truly magnificent dessert beer that provokes deep introspection and will make you think about the meaning of life while trying to get to the end of the aftertaste.",4.5,0.8779

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"2014 vintage. Extremely sweet, and this sweetness gets somewhat unpleasant after drinking too much. By too much I mean about 15oz. The flavor is completely out of balance. This lack of balance is usually a huge minus, but in this case, not necessarily. Loads of vanilla, bourbon, molasses, coffee, marshmallow, brown sugar, chocolate, and syrup in a bottle! Holy hell. Flavor is not overly complex, mouthfeel is thick, and the marshmallow flavor lingers on for a long long time. The flavor develops as the beer warms up. Guys, let this beer chill for at least a couple hours. I don’t know if this beer is ""the best stout ever"" but it surely is unique and worth trying.",4.8,0.8649

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord ’15 vintage 

Pours a brown-black color with a dark brown, small head to it, leaving back sheets of thin lacing atop the surface of the beer. Reveals its decadent viscosity after swirling, by revealing alcohol legs and tiny, dark brown bubbles at the glass.

Intense aromas of fudge, bakers chocolate and burned malts, tied together by a ridiculously rich Bourbon appearance, featuring flowery vanilla, a whiff of cinnamon, apple piths and a ton of scentened oak. Vanilla is easily detectable, while well entangled into the Bourbon, adding a organic, sweet, flowery freshness to the chocolate decadence. Mousse au chocolate, moldy earth, toffee and brownie batter round out this monster on the nose, so far truly a masterpiece, which I actually find hard to compare to the regular Dark Lord.

Has a supersmooth mouthfeel, due to its very low carbonation, next to a silk, omnipresent creaminess, coating the tongue and soothing the pleasantly integrated Bourbon effectivly.

Tastes of a spice soaked, earth coated oakiness, featuring the beers velvet mouthfeel from the start. Develops an enjoyable warmth, as the Bourbon unfolds its spice profile, together with vanilla, licorice, molasses and fudge. Vanilla certainly deserves an additional mentioning as it not only stands out from the Bourbon, but directly blends into the beers smooth cream quality, producing a heavenly, well accentuated sweetness, from which the profound spices benefit big times during the finish. Ends with cinnamon, red apple, fudge, molasses and a long lasting, silk, vanilla coke quality, smoothing out the Bourbon oak entirely.

Wow, what a behemoth of a beer. I guess it would be almost impossible to drink more of a few couple of oz of this, if it wasn’t for the soothing combination of cream and vanilla. This doesn’t turn overly roasty, but fudgy smooth with a ton of sweet chocolate to it, amped up by the spicy Bourbon. The different flavors come beautifully together, while this is still being best enjoyed in small sips, as for its profound sweetness.",4.3,0.9964

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"On tap at RateBeer Best. It pours dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is full with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream. Massively sweet to the point of being sugary. The flavor is the same with a good dose of chocolate and vanilla. The alcohol notes are strong, but it serves this kind of beer well by cutting the huge sweetness. Very thick bodied and somewhat port-like. It goes down warming and satisfying. One of the sweeter beers at this festival, but it was ultimately very fun stuff to drink. Hardly any roasted malt or bitterness.",4.1,0.9821

Bourbon and soy sauce dominated, it wasn't as thick as I expected on mouth. Beat BBT 2017 with a certain reluctance yet still inferior to KBBS. To be honest, I wasn't sure I could separate out this versus BCBS 2015 on blind. Still one of best non-adjunct Imperial Stout though.
此酒被波本桶和酱油味支配，入口没我想象的那么厚重。勉强超越了BBT2017，但还是比不上KBBS。说实话，跟BCBS2015放一块盲品，我都没把握百分百喝出来。尽管如此，它依旧是最好的非增味帝国世涛之一。

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Bottle enjoyed at DVHL on our 2019 Never to be Topped (challenge to forever do better) Belgium trip with Ian, Jason and James, with Matt and Adam as well. Definitely some bias attached to having this bottle...long-time want that I never thought I would get to try, and considering the model served us with his wife telling us some stories from the wedding and how things happened while eating her lunch beside us on her break...well needless to say hard to find a better setting. That being said given the prices per glass and how old the beer was, we were all excited but realized it might be a disappointment. But opened up with quite the pop, clear golden pour with a frothy white head. Still seems quite bright and fresh with an amazing barnyard funk, grass, hay, lemon, epson salt and nice mineral character, musty, delicate and a moderate+ carbonation and full body, long complex finish with more funk and barnyard, dry and somewhat fruity, keeps on going.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"2003 J and J version (not 50/50) drunk Summer of 2009 at my Farewell to the beer scene tasting
Inserted this one in the middle of the lineup, thankfully, so the palate was not fatigued. At almost six years old, it still poured a wonderfully frothy, white head, showing moderate retention and plentiful carbonation. Soft, straw/white-gold body, plenty of sediment on the bottom.
The nose creeps up on you, this is certainly not getting you by means of raw force/strength. The best part, and i will admit to being slightly hazy on all of the details, being that this was four years ago, was a soft, but yet tart hickory skin/limeade-like note that seemed to hover in the background and keep gaining strength as the beer warmed/breathed. Very dry and with tons of lactic acid but yet all well-presented. Some barnyard notes emerging late but just the most succulent, soft, yet strong brett notes I’ve witnessed.
In the mouth, the carbonation is fairly reserved for the style, with a warm woodiness that plays well with the tart, limey brett notes. Not overly sour, though significantly moreso than the Milennium gueuze I had a few months ago. Very ""true"" flavors of gueuze, lactic, brett fruity tartness, light band-aids; all that I associate with Girardin, though not as intensely sour as that usually seems. Interesting mineral-like note to it as well.  Finish leaves lactic acids lingering, with a bit of cheesiness and more unripened citrus fruits. Carbonation is soft by now, and the body is medium, with a supple texture from the malts and wheat. Wonder if I’ll ever try this again! Thanks to whomever traded me these (can’t remember at this point).
Bottle drunk 6/10/16, shared by Joe Z. Thanks!
Wow was this in just immaculate shape.  Even handily beat the Roze we opened just before it.  Limestone, white grape, soft oak, hickory nut skin, light band aids, very light sulfur....most of the stuff I look for in the top lambics.  Carbonation still VERY strong.  Texture is perfect.  Really can’t ask for much more from a gueuze.  Previously had it at 4.6.",5.0,0.9967
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Acquired in a trade from Mads in Denmark in February of 2013. Allowed this beer to sit horizontal in my basement for 10 months and now I’m ready to open it up on a random Saturday night by myself before a trip. Nothing fancy, just because. Also, temp of this thing is 55 at serving in a Cantillon Tulip. I allowed the glass I poured to sit for 15 minutes to sort of liven up a bit and just sort of chill the fuck out. It was bottled like 10 years ago...best let this beast chill! The cork was perfectly intact but had escaped out of the bottle by a couple of centimeters. The cage held up great.



A - Appearance is on par with Oude Gueuze Vintage 2002-2005 era. Mahogany oak and minor orange notes. A more reddish brown than gueuze being released today. Is that just age? Probably not because the 20 year old gueuze I’ve had from others wasn’t this dark. The cork whisper heavily but did not explode or gush thankfully.



S - There are a few levels to this nose. You can do a one ounce pour, swish heavily and you get this blossom or oranges, lemon skin, wet hay and musty fecal aromas. Then if you let the beer chill out for a bit, it’s this cheesy old shoe with what I’d consider to be the cheesiest basement aroma like the moldiest old stone basement. Something to consider at this age though is storage conditions.If it was kept in an old damp basement, that will certainly influence the nose.



T - This is probably the most orange and lemon forward gueuze I’ve ever had. It’s also the most moldy wet blanket gueuze I’ve ever had. I’m reviewing this beer over a few glasses so I can get the full effect. It’s not really sour, more tart like a lemon, fruity like clementines and moldy, funky just leathery wet hay. It is the most ""rotten"" tasting gueuze I’ve ever had and, to that effect, I freaking love it!



M - The carbonation is as I expected. Not a huge explosion just a nice cork wisp with a 1 finger head that faded slowly. The beer still explodes nicely on a heavy swish with a Harbaugh approved 15% carbonation (do I really have to explain to him what that means? He’s a freaking science teacher right?) Lingering rotten grapefruit rind sticks around.



O - For what Blauw is trading for now, it’s slowly moving past its prime. The first review was in May of 2005. So that well debated 10 year fall off that Drie Fonteinen gueuze has is starting to hit. I want to say the mold / damp hay I get is totally because of storage conditions which is understandable. Is this worth a case of Framboos? No way. It’s still really freaking delicious and hopefully people rating it now get to have more than an ounce of it. It’s best shared 2-3 ways like most 75CL Gueuze. Amazing this is a whale now but age & bottles in circulation will do that. Personally, Golden Blend, Armand & Tomme, Lente, Zomer and 2007 Oude Gueuze Vintage score higher than this in my book but for different reasons. They’re all younger than this beer and brighter. I prefer them to this but this gueuze was still an experience worth going through.",4.2,0.9955
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"Enjoyed July 13, 2013. Poured from a basket into a Drie Fonteinen stem. Cork shot out with a pop, and gushed about 2 ounces. Have glasses ready! Pours a mildly hazy, golden orange with three plus fingers of sticky, frothy white head. Lots of retention, and lacing. Smell is stunning. Overly ripe peaches and apricots, lemon rind, and a deep earthy funk. Incredibly well balanced and integrated. As it warms, the funk evolves, opening up with barnyard and minerally earth. The stone fruits become more prominent and tropical. I could smell this forever. Taste is bright peach flesh, funk, and tropical sour fruits. Some lemon rind. Lightly sweet. The funk becomes more pronounced as it warms, yet never overpowers the beautiful fruit aspect. Truly incredible how vibrant this is after 10 years. Despite being a massive gusher, this was perfectly carbonated. The balance of flavors lends this to be incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Simply, this beer was nearly flawless, and probably the best beer I’ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Vibrant in every way, yet utterly balanced.",4.9,0.9933

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"October 28th 2012: Bottle (750 ml). Shared by David Paquet, huge thanks David! Unclear orange with a medium diminishing white head that leave’s a small forever lasting white head and superb lacing. Beautiful beer!  Aroma is lemony with herbal/floral notes and mild Gueuze aroma characteristics. Taste is incredibly smooth and wonderfully complex. Fruits (lemon, grapefruit, apple, pineapple), wood, barnyard and leather. Dry and citric mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Except for the aroma that could have been a little more complex (probably mellowed with age though), there’s no flaws in this beer. Perfect balance, amazing complexity and great drinkability . It’s the nearest thing from a perfect Gueuze (and beer) that I’ve drank so far. The saddest things about this beer is that it would be the perfect ""go to"" gueuze but it’s rarer than Pope’s sh**.  

Updated: Bottle (750 ml). Tasted again at De Heeren van Liedekercke on April 20th 2014 just before Roze and Heerengueuze. My rating stay the same as the one up here. It was a little less bright and fresh (probably because of the bottle variation more than the age because there was no other sign of age in this one), but still one of the most amazing gueuze ever made. Near perfection.",4.7,0.9858

Barnyard yeastiness, hints of meaty grapefruit and lemon pith. A bit of cheddar cheese. Soft, complex flavors. Wonderful, but the taste is a bit muted and lacks some of the vitality I was expecting. Smooth and very drinkable. Active carbonation on the palate. Overall, a very pleasant experience. This bottle felt like it was starting its decline. Still, very good.",4.1,0.9768

Cantillon Don Quijote,"Bottle shared by Brad, (thank you!) on 10/8/16.
High clarity leaving behind the sediment and revealing a sunset-hued golden body with a surprisingly large, white head showing strong retention for the style.
The nose is quite grape-forward, showing what definitely smells very Concord-esque. Many say Welch’s grape jelly, and while I don’t think it’s that uncouth, there’s no denying the similarities. There’s definitely some light powdered sugar evident but the sourness/acidity is quite nicely controlled and it smells soft, mild, even, etc....No alcohol or flaws and not exactly a study in funk, but certainly some mineral, very light horseblanket and light grapeseed suggestions.
Flavor is surprisingly acidic with lots of grapeseed and grapeskin character. These types of grapes are very tannic and it shows here. It’s pretty nicely integrated with the lambic, though it’s still quite prominent. Tart acidity and a very tight, engaging carbonation keep it zesty, bright and refreshing, with soft, malt and wheat backing it. Dry, of course with interesting flavors arising from the combination of grape and lambic, as per usual. Still, I wouldn’t call this terribly funky, certainly not by Cantillon standards. Is that why it’s liked by so many?? That’s definitely not why I like Cantillon....",3.8,0.9924

Cantillon Don Quijote,"Bottle shared at Mikey’s - 2011 - Murky off-purple pour into cantillon tulip, this is perfection in a glass. Dank aroma of musty grapes, faint funky profile ultimately overpowered by the robust fruit. Extremely heady taste..musky and tart, though not bracing. Like a blended vignerrone and st. Lamvinus with some cobweb and equestrian essence to mellow things out. Big thank you to Franco for the expedited shipping and the opportunity to try this. Thanks also to the kind FedEx customs rep who said she would ""see what she could do"" after it was flagged. Can’t wait to see how this develops over the next decade.

After sharing and tasting many more bottles of this, at Dirty Truth Thanksgiving dinner 2011, at the lambic tasting in Monroe, the Stockholm lambic tasting 2013 ,and more recently at the Denver Ghost Tasting, this pour continues to illustrate why grape lambic embodies all that I desire in a beer. It really doesn’t get any better than this, having had nearly all the grape lambics and variants from Cantillon. Truly a special treat that defines a lambic lovers existence, the sweet forbidden Italian grape melded with the bright acidity of Cantillon lambic makes for a beverage not matched by any else on planet earth.",4.9,0.9885

Cantillon Don Quijote,"Review form notes dated 22 October 2011. 75cl bottle at Goblin Pub. Big thanks to Umberto for this one. It pours a hazy red/deep pink colour with a small white head. Aroma is pure grape juice upfront with a funky feet and cheesy aroma. Some sweet candy notes too. Taste is acidic and sweet with grapes and candies upfront. Midway through the sip you get some mineral qualities, almost salty, then cheese and dust and quite a lot of funk. Dry sour finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, a big personal whale and a very good lambic too. It’s probably no better than a SanLam in absolute terms, but the DQ is truly unique.",4.2,0.8399
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Bottle decanted and poured into a Cantillon tulip. Pour is a mildly hazy, juicy magenta. A finger of pink head. Smell is beautiful, rich grape and lemon acidity. A good dose of funk as well. Jammy grapes and lemon acidity on the taste. Grape flavor is rich, but not too sweet... balanced well with one of the cleanest funk profiles I’ve ever encountered. Minerally and delicious. Mouthfeel is rich, juicy, yet untterly drinkable. Dry finish. Overall... this might be tied with Blauw for the best beer I’ve ever had. Certainly the best fruited lambic. Perhaps we will meet again one day!",4.9,0.9881
Cantillon Don Quijote,Thanks do much to Travlr!!! The appearance of the beer is incredible. It looks like a passionfruit with blood orange. Taste is barnyard funk. This is incredible.,4.6,0.7608
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Bottle graciously shared by Eric at his tasting. Never thought I would try this stupid whale, thanks brah. Pours gorgeous murky pink with a tiny white head. As soon as you dig your nose into the glass your hit with the most beautiful, candy grape smelling flavor ever. On top of the grape dankness, there is a good bit of horseblanket, fruit skin, and barn. Flavor is concord grapes, acidic peach, vintage oak, blanket, and sour cherries. Dances on the tongue with a perfectly balanced body. This is honestly the best smelling and tasting lambic I have encountered. If you are lucky enough to try this lambic, make sure you have some Kleenex or a jizz rag with you. Cheers",4.9,0.9883
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Bottle courtesy of Eric. Huge thanks to this beautiful beer. Pours a hazy murky reddish amber body with light white lacing. Aroma is candy grape flavor and nice funk.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"I’ve had this beer 5 or so times out of both 375ml & 750ml bottles. Original review 08-23-10 from 375ml bottle.



Pours a reddish/orange color, fizzy white head. Some lacing along the sides of the glass and a thin film on top as the cap. Grape juice, oak, funk/tart. I’m a huge fan of the Concord grape juice-esk smell. The funk melds wonderfully with the grapes and the oak notes are an added bonus. Solid. Grapes, tart/sour notes, slight oak, fruit characteristics, some must old barn in there as well. I am in lust with this beer. Light, champagne-esk lively carbonation, dry finish.



One of the best beers I’ve ever had, no doubt.",4.7,0.9776
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Wow. The Don lives up to the hype. Nose is grape juice. Strongly reminiscent of concord grapes, some oak, hint of funk. Cloudy light red/dark pink. Taste is superb.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"HUGE thanks to Umberto for busting out this rare treat during our epic drinking session at The Goblin Pub in Pavullo nel Frignano, Italy. Your generosity knows no limits! 

Pours a hazy, bright amber color with golden orange edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind. 

Sweet vinous aroma with a really strong grape presence countered by a decent amount of musty funk. Nice earthy barnyard character with some horseblanket, lactic funk, cobweb, oak and grape must. Subtle acetic presence but the sweet grape and vinous dark fruit notes keep it in check. Very inviting nose with the vinous fruit and musty funk complimenting each other perfectly. 

Tart and puckering with a good amount of sourness but it never becomes harsh or overly acidic. Lots of earthy barnyard funk and sweet, vinous fruit notes balance things out. Kind of reminds me of fresh St. Lamvinous but just a bit sweeter and more vinous. There’s a very prominent grape presence that counters the dry, musty funk and sour acidity nearly perfectly. Surprising how prominent the vinous fruit still is after four years. Some brett and lactic funk contribute to the complexity yet this beer remains delicate and easy to drink with some lingering acetic flavor in the finish that leaves me drooling for more. I could see this being too sweet and not sour enough for some people but I loved the balance of flavors.",4.6,0.9973
Cantillon Don Quijote,"750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin.  Huge thanks to Mike for sharing this rarity.  The Don pours cruddy reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.    The musty, earthy grape juice.  Lots of grape juice, like Welch’s.  There is also an aroma that smells like smarties as well as a bit of a mineral note and very light sulfur.  The initial taste has a bit of sweetness with lots of musty grape juice.  It is fairly tart with lactic acid.  The smarties come through in the taste as well.  The finish is drying with more grape juice.  There as also a slight astringency.  Medium body.  Medium-low carbonation.  This beer is certainly unique and very good.  The Don lives up to the hype.",4.4,0.9856
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Sampled March 2011; RBWG

The beer pours with a pale, wispy head that sits on top of a pale-purple tinged, amber colored beer. The nose has a really foxy (as in wild grape) note that sort of leans towards Concord grapes up front. There is a back note of mustiness, more moldy character, and some plastic-phenolic funkiness. It smells nicely tart, with more lactic notes than anything, but definitely some other acids round things out here as well. A butyric and goat-muskiness lightly touches the finish of the aroma.



As the beer first hits my mouth it tastes tart, but then gets more sharp and sour as it rolls across the tongue. This has a big, sharp, sourness in the end, but it is not acetic; some of the acidity must be from the grapes, as it is not entirely lactic in character. Linger flavors of foxy grapes melds with musky, and slightly moldy notes, as well as a touch of phenols that are almost plastic like in character. The plastic notes get a bit more prominent as the beer warms up. This is very dry, quite funky and the lemon-like tartness help immensely as well. A Brettanomyces signature plays a big role here, but part of the funkiness certainly comes from the particular grapes use. This is very light and quaffable (at least if you really like sours), but doesn’t come off as being watery or thin.



This is really nice, I would have loved to have had more, but this is certainly an awesome way to start off a grand tasting event. I like that this is super tart, and it is just so nicely evocative of musky, foxy, grapes and funk. This beer has definitely inspired me to find more funky, foxy, indigenous / wild grape varieties to use in Sour beers of my own; the signature that the grapes have left on this beer is just so interesting and intriguing.",4.1,0.9978

Review #600

Vintage 2008
Bottle 64L

A: The appearance is radiant orange/red, akin to grape juice. The beer has a small head and leaves just a trace of lacing, typical of a Cantillon lambic.

S: The aroma is fantastic, with a balance of classic Cantillon funk and freshly squeezed grape juice.

T: Like the aroma, the flavor is grape juice and funk. The beer is not overly sour or funky, but I certainly would not describe it as sweet, even though grapes / grape juice are very prominent.

M: Medium thin bodied. The aftertaste is fantastic. The balance of funk and lambic flavors with fruit is wonderful.

D: A pleasure to drink. I could have sipped this all night, if only that were possible.",4.5,0.9904
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Been waiting a long time for this day. My biggest personal whale for as long as I can remember. Pours a cloudy pinkish brownish red...kinda resembles a grapefruit in color actually. Small white head of tight, white bubbles. Nose is explosive fruit, specifically a mix of welch’s grapes and grapefruit. I don’t know where people were getting the shit/dirty diaper notes on this before, I think this smells amazing.  Doesn’t have as much of the Cantillon funk I expected. Flavor is incredibly tart, there is still a good amount of grape present, but I’ve been told its faded quite a bit since the last bottle the group had opened. There is some light lemon, but again, a lot less than a typical Cantillon offering. Light mouthfeel, good acidity, good carbonation, and a long finish. Such a great experience! I was skeptical that it wouldn’t hold up to the hype, but this beer is incredible. I think I need to follow through on getting one for the cellar. Thanks for going after this guy with me Ethan and Chris!",5.0,0.9647
Cantillon Don Quijote,"From notes, had last year at Goblin.  Pours light red with a small pinkish off white head.  Nose is grapes, berries, light citrus, vinegar and funk.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"reviewed 01-08-2012. never ever thought i would be doing this.... pour was a faint red with some violet. head was white and frothy with a hint of faint color like light red in it. some retention and lacing. pour was from towards the top so it was fairly clear and clean. scent was interesting. lots of cheese, old sweat, musty, with this light sharpness and intense concord grape. very complex and interesting. starts out quite sour and intense, then starts to fade out with a just amazing combination of subtle oak, mustiness, and straight grape in the finish. the grape just sits on the tongue. nice and dry with some help from the oak. nice mild carbonation, slight sweetness. this was amazing, lots of interesting characteristics all over it.",4.5,0.9887
Cantillon Don Quijote,"Sampled at STLWill’s 30th b-day tasting. This was a beer where the nose and the taste were worlds apart for me.  Pours clear copper with a small white head.  The aroma has lots of unrefined wood, body odor, dirty grapes, light sourness and bugginess - this didn’t give me high hopes.  The body is light/medium as is smooth by the breweries standards along with mild carbonation.  The taste starts off with a husky/grainy quality that has a sweet/tart taste that’s very buggy and highly acidic.  The grapes didn’t come out to me until the finish and they came out big there with the Concord flavor.  Lots more acidity on the finish as well.   A great beer, just didn’t care for the aroma.",4.0,0.8979
Cantillon Don Quijote,"750 ml bottle sampled at STLWill’s 30th birthday party- thanks, again! Pours a murky reddish gold color with a white ring for a head.

Pretty damn sour and tart. Dry, with moderate carbonation. Pretty damn amazing.",4.6,0.9354
Cantillon Don Quijote,"So very fortunate to try this one.  From notes, bottle share at CDC b4 release.  From such a small sample I got so much.

Flavor is thinner, lightly sugary with white grape skins, very drying finish sourness lasting. No pepper or ultra dryness like Pinot daunis, grape skin appears sweet and thinner as a result, even softer body (how can anyone complain d’aunis dry tongue-rake is ""still"" compared to this?).

The pour is quite hysterical- sort of a clear, neon purple with deep sunset highlights. A short lived pink head fizzes. Dregs at the end look opaque fuschia. Nose is at first a lot of white grape juice moving to sweet strawberry and tangy rhubarb. Very bright aroma and sweet grape juice and even hints of cinnamon and clove. Taste is straight geuze all the way with big tanginess, white pepper, mild berry character, and ruby red grapefruit sections and peel. Acidity level is perfect- juicy and tangy. Vibrant and bright. Perfect palate. Very yummy overall though I’m told the grape robustness is falling off and instead gaining more normal geuze complexity like older Blabaer batches.",4.1,0.9907

a - Pours a somewhat murky raspberry pink color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident.

s - Smells of oak, welch grapes, tart fruit, funk, yeast, and a little manure. I like the smell and did not get as much manure as some people do, but it’s definitely the weakest part of the beer in my opinion.

t - Tastes of oak, grapes, tart apples, funk, tart fruit, and earthy notes.

m - Light body and low carbonation, awesome smooth body. Insanely easy to drink.

d - I thought this was an outstanding beer, aside from the smell. I just couldn’t get over the small manure in the smell to give this a better grade; without that this one would have been even better. Would love to have again and very glad I even got to try this one once.",4.5,0.9903

Cantillon Don Quijote,"Opened by Thorpe429, thanks -- huge want of mine and a pretty good grape lambic. 

Beer is pinkish / purple and hazy with a thin diffuse head of tiny bubbles that don’t leave any lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low. Looks pretty good for a sour.

Aroma is fruity, like grapes with a sulfurish (not in a bad way) undertone and mild lactic sourness. I was expecting some more acetic, it was there but I’m not sure why I thought this would be vinegar. 

Beer is light in body and has a mild sweetness to it, its lactic and acetic sour with hints of citric acid as well. Its not too complex, not getting a lot of grass or hay but there is a mild oakiness to it but without the vanilla, more the funk. Its nice and easy to drink. I think I like Lamvinous better but this is a good beer and I would definitely drink it again.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"HUGE thanks to Sean for this. Shared with Sean, Mike, and Alex on an awesome Sunday afternoon...375ml bottle into a Lost Abbey glass...Pours a light and bubly purple, kind of dark out but nothing special...The aroma is the best sour ever. It has the smoothest but deepest funk ever, almost manure like but in an appealing way. The first funk that actually really brings me back to the smell of visting my grandparents ranch in Texas. What makes this aroms even better is that its balanced nice with sweet smell of grapes a perfect combo to break up the depths of the funk...The taste thankfully picks up for the most part where the aroma left out. Funk is there but now the grapes come through more, a touch to much of the grapes. 

This is a top beer by far and must get for all Cantillon lovers, no matter the cost. I’d love to have this again side by side with blabaer just to see which of these is truly not only the best Cantillon but best sour in the world. Yeah, its that good.

MBCC2017 Backlog. Pours a dark ruby/purple with no head or carbonation. This is in a lot of ways similar to it's regular version but manages to pack in even more tastes. It still has that intense, fruit jam concentrate berry presence of raspberry, blueberry, blackberry. In this version it's a bit more subdued though. Less fruit sweetness and more of a deep rich caramel, fudge, vanilla input from the barrel. Tartness has stepped aside for more tannic oak qualities. The barrel gives this lovely complexity that has an almost earthy note to it yet is unremarkably present in it's sweetness. This is so unbelievably tasty, could sip on it forever.",4.8,0.969

Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a cloudy, bright golden yellow color with a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. 

The aroma of this beer is pretty remarkable. It’s just bursting with fresh tropical fruit notes while being countered by lactic funk, bready yeast and citrus. Lots of mango, papaya, pineapple and other tropical fruits but it still smells like a Berliner. A decent amount of earthy funk, wheat/bread and a touch of citrus balance things out.

Medium bodied with an explosion of tropical fruit notes that linger over subtle funk and acidity into a dry finish. Similarly to the aroma, there is a ton of amazing tropical fruit flavor but it still has the qualities of a berlinerweisse. A bit sweet perhaps but there is still some wheat/bready yeast flavor along with subtle acidity and lactic funk countering the fruit notes. Refreshing and delicious.",4.5,0.9764

S - A tropical explosion, to say the least. The sour/tart notes aren’t quite as strong as the Passionfruit/Dragonfruit, which is nice. Citrus, mango, pineapple, mandarin oranges. So refreshing.

T - I would drink this beer every morning with my breakfast, if I could. Huge tropical sweetness, so fresh...just like the fruits from the market and put into my drink. The tartness is really nice and subtle, which makes this chuggable. Finish is light tartness and fruits.

M - Light, uber-refreshing, good carbonation, dry tart finish.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"750 mL bottle. Unknown original review date, but sometime before June 26, 2012.
Jet black with a chocolate head. Inky and glass staining as always.

Whiskey is very dominant on the nose. All the flavors of whiskey, chocolate, and peppers come through in one whiff. They blend seamlessly into a great nose.

Tastes of whiskey up front, as the aroma would indicate. It’s a different aroma from Bourbon, which I didn’t quite expect. I thought I wouldn’t be able to discern a Whiskey barrel from a Bourbon barrel in a big beer like this. It’s less intense than a Bourbon barrel and allows the beer to come through. Chocolate and peppers not as well blended as in the aroma. The whiskey flavor is very sharp, especially in the finish.

Very thick. Seems to have retained its body better than Virgin Oak did. Very heavy and tough to drink. A sipper, I suppose.
Wonderful flavors, but it’s so big. The complexities of Hunahpu are a little lost from the barrel, but the barrel does well to accommodate.",4.5,0.9544

Couleur noire huile de moteur laissant un léger filament huileux et doré sur le verre, ce dernier s’atténue rapidement. Le col de couleur moka se dissipe rapidement.
Arôme garde ici tout le bouquet généreux de Hunahpu tel que je m’en souviens. Malté, chocolat riche s’entrechoquent avec des notes d’épices suivi d’une rondeur boisée de whiskey donnant une pointe douce vanillée. Caramel sur côté toffee. La chaleur des piments reste modérée mais ajoute un bouquet subtile qui garde une pointe d’épice avec le renfort de la cannelle.
Palais est simplement sublime. Chocolat est profond et épais sur un léger pimenté qui vient titiller chaque gorgée. 
Le whiskey est doux, rondeur du boisé américain typique qui donne une belle douceur vanille en bouche. Cette dernière accompagne un palais très complexe. Retrouve un chocolaté généreux et épais agrémenté par cette fine chaleur de piments. Le tout couvre une pointe de fumé qui suit en fin de bouche.
Seul point négatif, bière à boire à t° de pièce mais qui en se réchauffant commence à prendre des notes de soja.

Reste une bière unique, qui se vaut d’être partagée. Du gros calibre à boire, que dis-je, à déguster tranquillement. Une expérience gustative. Le whiskey est subtile, présent mais sans pour cela dominer. Cela laisse à la version de base assez de place pour briller tout en profitant de mûrissage.",4.6,0.5719

Blacker than black with a paper thing espresso crema head which fizzles into oblivion. Sucked in by a black whole maybe? Rests still and unwavering with a few trepid swirls leaving a black oily slick in its wake.


Nose:
Burnt black licorice. Pure unfettered cacao – brittle, bitter, roasty, and burnt espresso caramel crema. Sweet heat and spice along the sides and rounding out in the back. Whiskey soaked black chocolate covered raisins. Black cake.


Palate:
Intense but not intensely complex. Dark chocolate fudge and brownies. A silky mouthfeel carries each delicate flavor from beginning to finish. Spicy heat tickles the back of my throat with whisky and the cask it was previously aged int. Black root and more fudge mingle. Oily on the lips while dry and brittle on the tongue – cacao beans.


Final Thoughts:
Between the Rum and the Whiskey, I enjoyed both but if I had to lean in one direction, it would be in the direction of the rum. Both were amazing beers though and while I don’t know what new used barrel deliciousness Cigar City has in store for their next Hunahpu release, I’ll have to make sure I am there and ready.",4.3,0.9643

Went from black leather to a dark mocha colored head. Two finger head that settled to a thick film. Just gorgeous looking. Big oily residue of ABV legs and sediment. Good spotty lacing. 

S-- Yikes. Chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon,an nutmeg. Barrel notes were soft but did get vanilla, oak, and carmel. Really thought the base beer somewhat overshadowed the barrel. Not complaining though. 

T-- Thick and rich. Massive array of flavors. Vanilla, chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon, oak, vanilla and carmel. Like drinking a thick milkshake.

M-- Thick and oily. Big but not overly big or sweet at all. Quite smooth really and still chewable at the same time. Low carbonation. What was really memorable was the chillies really made an impact in this. As in the heat in the mid an back palate. Had heartburn the next day from it. Nice touch.

The aroma is the smoothest of the bunch, and the most subtle- whiskey, oak, molasses, toasted brown sugar, vanilla, and coconut. The chili pepper just barely peeks through. The flavor is just as smooth and hits the same notes, but not quite with the same richness- chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, mild roast, and maybe more pepper than the nose.

The beer is, like all of the Hunahpu’s variants, profoundly dark. Ominous black with a thick, oily beige head. An awesome appearance for an imperial stout. Lacing stains the glass.

The aroma offers some whiskey/booze, roast. Again, not a grandiose aroma, but what’s there smells attractive.

The flavor is a bit more forward than the bourbon version, with a slight whiskey kick in the finish. Delicious.

Full bodied with moderately low carbonation. Smooth on the palate with alcohol pretty tame.

Pours pitch black with a dark mocha head that quickly settle into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lace left behind. 

Strong barrel character in the aroma aroma with a prominent whiskey presence. Subtle toasted oak with sweet and roasted malt notes underneath.  Hints of chocolate, toffee, hazelnut and coffee.  Subtle vanilla and peppers.  Peppers seem to be muted by this treatment. 

Thick bodied and viscous with a strong barrel presence that gives off lots of whiskey and toasted oak that dominates the flavor.  Some vanilla and toasted coconut as well.   The strong barrel flavors are followed by sweet and roasted malts that become more prominent as it warms.  Lots of chocolate with a mix of sweet and roasted notes along with some coffee bean, caramel and toffee.  The cinnamon and peppery heat show up toward the finish but again are slightly muted by the strong whiskey flavor.  Decent amount of heat but abv is nicely masked.  Another solid Hunahpu treatment.  Viscous and complex yet still pretty easy to drink.  The barrel presence is a bit strong for my liking but it doesn’t hurt the flavor too much.",4.0,0.9881

There's a bit of fruit, mostly grape, pairing very nicely with cream (in taste and texture), espresso aftertaste, but the overall effect is closer to a marriage of Slivovitz and Kahlua than beer. That being said, a reasonably fun one, if expectations have been adjusted. [2018.08.03: 3.9]",3.9,0.8526

So at a full six years of age, you can't really fault a beer for being well past its prime. That being said, this was specifically designed to lay down, which I did, since acquiring it young, in a wine fridge. So I was, I think understandably/justifiably, VERY disappointed when this thing was just plain DEAD. I mean, I could understand if it was well past its prime or something, but this was just fully oxidized soy sauce. Will certainly get a bottle to rerate and just put in an average placeholder score.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt. I will remember this for the rest of my existence and I will keep the empty bottle in my cellar, only to look at it every now and then with a feeling of nostalgia...",4.6,0.9994

Pours a viscous, jet black color with no head, while some chunks of coconut float in the brew.

Sweet aromas of cane sugar, toffee, molasses, and burned coconut. These blend well into wooden, slightly boozy, hot barrel qualities, among bakers chocolate.

Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, super creamy, drinks like chocolate with loads of cocoa nibs and glazed, slightly burned coconut. The bourbon acts as an intriguing counterpart to that, providing wood and earthy maltiness without revealing any booziness, less intense than the sweeter parts of the stout, still easily balancing the beer. Instead of a noteable carbonation, there is smooth creaminess, heading into a mousse au chocolate direction. The Bourbon in this beer is by no means dominant on its own, but blends perfectly into the chocolate qualities.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"On tap at GTMW 2014


Making a beeline for the Goose Island tent as soon as the gates opened I was able to get two pours of this amazing imperial stout. A world class release, this version of Bourbon County Stout made the ticket worthwhile on its own. While I am unlikely to pick up a bottle because of the cost I look forward to trying a few more at festivals and other special tappings.



Aroma / Appearance - An inky black base with long legs creeps from the pitcher into the glass. Anise, coffee, chocolate, and heavy booze rise into the air like dense smoke. Vanilla accents add even more depth. The Templeton Rye peeks out from time to time but due to the general heaviness does not stand out on its own.



Flavor / Palate - Strong malt, coffee, smoke, and Templeton Rye stick to the tongue and throat. Chewy after just a few seconds, the mouthfeel offers something for everybody as it crawls to a bitter warm finish. Despite all that it never feels suffocating. Six to eight ounces would be a perfect pour as I’m not sure I could finish much more on my own in one sitting without having a whole evening.",4.4,0.9365

Toppling Goliath SR-71 Blackbird (2015 Bottling / Draft),"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Travis’s house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2015 vintage, 22 oz bottle shared by me. The pour on these TG stouts is crazy. Dark black, thick and viscous with a thin brown ring of head that dissipates without leaving a trace. The aroma is excellent. Chocolate, fudge, vanilla, heavy roast, a ton of molasses, light hints of dark fruits, tons of bourbon. It’s just as good as Assassin, but the flavor is where it separates itself. The molasses is huge. The chocolate and vanilla fudge are incredible. The thick roast and light charred oak balance incredibly. The booze is lighter than the nose and adds just a subtle offering. This is spectacular. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly sweet molasses and chocolate and vanilla fudge with a hint of bourbon. Fuck this is good.",4.8,0.8885

The aroma is a bit overly woody at first, but as it opens up it’s really got a nice chocolate & raisin thing going on. The light booze, big raisin, super rich and nicely woody thing remind me a lot of Pedro Ximénez, in fact blindfolded I might think this was PX going strictly on aroma. 



The flavor is big on woodiness and booze, but there are some nice toasted marshmallow, caramel, and vanilla things going on. As it warms it gets a little more fudge like and gets a nice little bit of raisin in there too.

Lovely and rich. Initial is offers a firmer body, caramel and oak meet toffee, cocoa and roast. Coffee and espresso come on with jabs of vanilla, nice warming barrel that doesn’t interfere. Lushious, fudgey and a nice coffee element as we keep moving. The barrel is well integrated here, offering some mellow warmth, firmer vanillin and oak elements. The thick big body beneath is properly thinned, offering a complex mélange of rich flavors. Mocha, caramel, and fudge with a richer coffee element as we hit the backend. Great flow, flavor, good body and barrel ratio.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Finally - Beer #11 of my 10,00th Beer Milestone Celebration, and RATING #10,000 itself!!!!!
2017 Vintage Bottle (A Mounted Police Officer on the Horse)
Ridiculously dark brown coloured body, almost an oily black coloured body without much transparency at all (some at the edges when tilted) and a nice three centimetre tall rich light brown and deep tan head on top that stays afloat for a while and leaves a nice lace on the side as it fades. Aroma of very strong chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, oatmeal, molasses, alcohol and the strongest here - maple syrup (just as it should be) with a great finish of warm alcohol and sugars in the nose - very strong smelling, indeed. Full-bodied; Rich, super sweet and decadent maple syrup, woodsie, bourbon and roasted malt notes dominate up front with a lot of residual sugars from pitted fruits, molasses and toffee with a pungent malt backbone that really brings out the oats and grainy notes with some slight nutty and woodsie flavours, but the roasted oatmeal and rich coffee notes really penetrate the sugars here with a nice balance to bring out the strong sugars at the end and some alcohol warmth at the finale to make this FEEL nice as well. Aftertaste is super potent and rich a lot of alcohol, a ton of roasted malts and oatmeal here, but the pitted fruits, cream, coffee, molasses and especially maple syrup sweetness notes are the strongest on the end, which they should be for the style and for how long this has been aged. Overall, a great beer of course and one that should be sampled if you can get your hands on it (it seems much easier than when I bought this one originally [this is my original bottle, but I have many in my cellar right now] from the store) and especially to buy a couple and age some of them for a longer period of time (in optimal conditions, of course), as I have another bottle from this same purchase that I might have in another 5 or 10 years on a special occasion. Great to sample of course and as a Michigander and as someone who loves real Maple Syrup, this was only fitting to have as my BEER #10,000 and for such a special occasion after aging it for almost six years myself. Great to sample and while I like writing so much for each beer, this one finally ushers in a change for me to simplify my ratings entirely and post much less 'wordie' ratings and verbose typings as I have been doing for my FIRST 10,000!

GLASSWARE: Lindemans stemmed tulip... pours a viscous jet black body that rolls out a a number of upward-cascading rivulets of effervescence... its head continues the show, stabilized as a thick half-finger's worth of light tan, creamy foam approximating a latte's froth... rich vanilla, maple syrup, mellow bourbon sweetness, a hint of smoke, some alcoholic heat... then heavy coffee bean and roasted malts arrive, and the profile is quite a celebration.... the first sip is frothy at the start, turning to velvet-smooth satin past the tongue and a warm entrancing finish that fires well after... the teeth pulse--the hops are in here--and the mouth holds its presence... the alcohol draws in and around, but like the best, it isn't tasted, but rather, appreciated... rich is the word--each sip is a dessert in itself, a settling, centering mood boost that makes one appreciate.... a massive collision of syrup and coffee initially arrest with intensity, before the sweet bourbon, charcoal smokiness, chocolate, and lactic acids round the experience into a drink worth mulling over... I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a fantastic rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. The cinnamon and chili work really well with the peppery, spicy rye barrel character, although I have to say that the cinnamon presence is way overdone here for my personal taste and that there is also not quite enough of a bitter/roasty counterpoint to the sweeter chocolate and vanilla notes.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Well, here we are then: one of the biggest whales from Belgium, the legendary start of Dolle's Special Reserva editions and therefore the very first beer in Belgium to have been deliberately aged on wooden casks which previously contained another beverage, red Bordeaux wine in this case. The pioneering role of Dolle Brouwers cannot be underestimated, in being the first non-family-owned craft brewery in Belgium (around 1980, the same time as the beginnings of Abbaye des Rocs' brewing activities); then in 2000, this Special Reserva series, which is continued to this day and has been applied not only to Stille Nacht but also to Oerbier and on one occasion to Dulle Teve (of which a new one is in the process of preproduction now), marks the beginning, at least in Belgium, of what is now common practice among craft breweries around the world. The brewer, Kris, was generous enough to offer us a vertical tasting of all Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions yesterday and needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for his kind generosity - I did have a few Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions before, but never this legend, the ultimate one, a whale I never thought I would ever be able to taste. Carefully opened by Kris himself, the 17 year-old 75 cl bottle, with rusty crown cap and charmingly moldy and partially disintegrated label, did effectively - and contrary to my expectations - produce a minimal head upon pouring, in the form of a thin ring of eggshell-white, loosely knit bubbles, which expectedly disappeared shortly thereafter; the beer itself was of a most beautiful and intense, almost glowing orange-amber colour with a molten copper-like hue, clear initially but hazy with sediment near the finishing of the bottle. A milky cloud of dead yeast and proteins appeared only in the very end. The aroma was of an unbelievable complexity, depth and beauty - I cannot recall ever having sniffed any barleywine (because that is basically, though perhaps unintentionally, what were are talking about here) that comes close to this: gooseberry jam, candied orange peel and marmelade, beguiling vanilla-ish wet oak wood, sweet white dessert wine, honey liqueur, armagnac, matured sweet sherry, old cider, amaretto, marzipan, fresh fig juice, moist raisin bread and, as a sign of its respectable age, hints of wet cardboard and damp cellar, only adding charm, maturity and complexity. The onset was sweet, lush and almost 'praline'-like, hinting at candied figs, sugared fried apples and sweet raspberry jam, drenched in an orangey marmelade sauce with a light sourish sherry hint, that stretches towards the finish where it becomes more outspoken - though a kaleidoscopic, utterly refined and ravishingly beautiful candied sweetness remains the main flavour. Carbonation is evidently very soft (but not at all flat!), resulting in a thick, very vinous, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Thick layers of caramelly and slightly cookie-like malt sweetness with honey and marmelade sweetness on top blend with an unbelievably deep and rich finish, where sweet dessert wine flavours (rather than actual Bordeaux, strangely) are added, tannic woodiness renders a gently drying effect and very sherry-like oxidation, of the noblest kind I may ever have encountered in any vintage beer, establishes a deeply elegant and luscious maturity. Vanilla-, marmelade-, marzipan- and cognac-like impressions make this almost like a liquid crêpe Suzette - with yeasty breadiness added in the very end, soaked in brandy-like alcohol warmth. This is, along with some of the greatest lambics, the most impressive Belgian beer I ever tasted - I feel humbled by this, and not just because of its legendary status in the craft beer world. It is hard to describe, even for me, how beautiful, opulent, deep and aristocratic this beer is; this is without any doubt at the very top of what beer can do in a gastronomical sense, so I cannot but give this the perfect score - if this doesn't deserve that, then I don't know what does. What makes it all the more remarkable, is that it has remained in such mint condition after seventeen years - this only adds to the fact that this product was made and cared for with utmost knowledge, skill and experience. My deepest gratitude goes out to Kris, not only for being so immensely generous to offer this and other bottles for our tasting session, but for giving a beer as utterly beautiful as this to the world. A whole string of young craft breweries today, in Belgium but also on an international level, can and should learn from this. A day to never forget!",5.0,0.9996

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"10th September 2011
Cloudy orange - brown beer. Decent sized white head. Nose reminds me very much of a Vintage Port cork that has just been pulled. Palate is soft and semi dry and quite well carbonated. Mild caramel malt backbone, tasting slightly aged. Riding over all this are rich wine notes. Red wine with strawberry and then later on blackberry and blackcurrant. Agitating the beer produces some lactose on the nose. Aniseed becomes more obvious. There is a surprising amount of carbonation here and much agitation is required to remove it! The finish is dry and woody. This is the most Port like beer I’ve ever had. Even the Port barrel beers have not been this porty. If you look at recent ratings people are saying this is past it’s best. Who knows but judging it on it’s own merit it’s still quite remarkable it it’s uniqueness and rich flavour. The alcohol is still quite robust. The most surprising thing about this is that De Dolle have never redone this. 2013 postscript - they must have read my mind!

That’ll be me 20K then @ ChrisO’s. Almost clear orange beer, small cream colour head. Light palate, decent fine carbonation. Lovely Port Wine flavours with vibrant crystallised fruits.

This beer was held in a colling room at constant temperature for the past 12 years, i’m mearly stating this because i was sceptic about keeping beer chilled all those years and i thought it would kill some of the flavours.

This beer has proved me wrong, as most raters tend to say the beer had gone sour i can’t do anything but saying this beer wasn’t sour at all and has held up superbly !!! 


Head: bottle fizzed ( not gushing just making a sound ) and carbonation was still pretty damn good, white but very thin had that gets out of the way after a couple of minutes 

Colour: totally clear , golden/amberish 

Smell: sweet malts, touch of honey, ever so slight booze that blends perfectly  with the other scents, touch of dairy 

Taste: texture is thick and sweet just like a fine high quality Sauternes !!, superb flavours that are impossible to describe, i don’t know what the beer tsted like fresh, but it’s probabbly pretty close but mellowed to what it actually was, i have never ever had a aged beer that was so balanced, smooth, lively and perfect after 12 ( and even less ) years of aging !.

I never give beers a 5-star rating because i think the perfect beer doesn’t exist, but i’ve been proven wrong , this beer is perfect in my eyes, and if i would be able to trade my cellar for this beer i would do it without a doubt !!!

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"750mL Bottle, poured at the B. United table of Beervana - Cranston, RI. Thanks to Matthias for opening this gem. I can’t believe I actually got to try this beer. I had to wait in line for a long time, but it happened. I think the age makes this a bit anticlimatic, as the nose opens with a fair dose of oxidation, despite persistent carbonation and a solid cork. Interestingly, the wet apple note that comes with the oxidation seems to bolster the Calvados-like nature of this beer. The warm, spiced fruit and cooked apple characters of this beer persist and the heat continues to show. Sparklingly dry. A treat for sure, but past its prime.",3.8,0.9531
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"Thanks a lot to madmitch for the chance to try this rare beer. Looks good in the glass, not as dark as exspected, small head. Malty-old aroma.

Warming aftertaste, goes down burning. Probably already a bit over its top, but still an awesome beer!",4.0,0.9346

 Bottle shared with 3/4 and kmweaver. Sweet vinous nose, lots of candied red fruits, toffee and caramel in abundance, light oxidation. Sweetness is upfront on the taste, but it’s not overwhelming, alcohol is there, but kept in check. Caramel and toffee is lightly oxidized producing a sherry note along with a bit of figs and raisins.

Aroma is incredible: tons of nectar fruit like apricot and nectarine, great sweet vinous notes, wood from the barrel aging, raisin and other dark fruits, and some angel food cake and Belgian yeast. Flavor is absolutely freakish. Huge notes of maple candy, nectarine, grape, caramel, brown sugar, plum, raisin, and wine-- so sweet, but so unbelievably good.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"Tap at AleSmith Brewery Tap Room

Aroma: well rounded roasted aroma, caramel, coffee. But this beer really have a great balanced flavor. The coffee, malt and bourbon scents are all there and very distinct. High definition, and great smell. Usually, a stout will have multiple levels of smells and they would be blended together, but this stout have all scents and they are very easy to pick out. And it's the authentic coffee, authentic roasty smell. 4.6/5

Appearance: At a certain stage when everything is correct, I look for the corners. This beer hits all the marks, and what I have to say is the lace. Truly beautiful. Great lace retention. 4.6/5

Flavor: again, very similar to the aroma, this beer is great on all flavors, and the barrel aging just make all the flavors more balanced and all rounded. I can clearly take the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, malt. I would say this is indeed THE BEST STOUT I have tried so far. 4.75/5

Mouthfeel: smooth, thick, full body, but with all the good sides on bourbon. 4.5/5

Overall: The reason why I love this beer is because it just brings all the designed flavors in a very great way. Since they have another blue mountain coffee stout version, and this Vietnamese coffee is just a bit better. I don't wanna give it a 10/10 since you never know if there are more good stuff outta there. 18/20.",4.5,0.9982

The flavor follows suit with the notes of rich dark chocolate and darkly roasted coffee and earthy bitterness up front and backed up nicely by the burnt caramel and the dark roasted malt base. As it warms the bourbon and oak laden vanilla really shine along with a nice nutty character. Really nice balance between the rich and roasty coffee and the bourbon barrel. Full bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy dark chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, and bourbon oak finish that just lingers long after each sip.

Nie spodziewałem się, że ten dzień tak szybko nadejdzie i w dość szybkim tempie dojdę do tego poziomu.
Ba! Nie zamierzam się nawet wycofać i dalej podążam w poszukiwaniu tzw. beer whalez. 
Zostało już ich na prawdę niewiele (oczywiście mowa o tych nieodhaczonych w Top50 RB;). Niektóre będą niezwykle ciężkie do zdobycia, ale wierzę, że uda mi się kiedyś wypełnić ranking powiedzmy do poziomu 45/50.
Cheers!🍻

Alkohol: 12% obj.

Wersja: 2016

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy diabła. Kompletny brak przejrzystości.

Piana: Trudna do zidentyfikowania, ponieważ po odkapslowaniu pojawił się mocny gushing. Beżowy kolor i struktura składająca się z małych, beżowych oczek. 
Szybko skurczyła się do obrączki pozostawiając ładne krążki na ściankach. 

Zapach: Niezapomniany, wszechobecny aromat.
Jest tutaj wiele warstw wtajemniczenia.
Beczka po bourbonie wnosi intensywną woń czekolady, cukierków Kukułek, wanilii i przypalonego karmelu.
Tuż za nią podąża aromatyczna, mocno palona kawa.
Kroku również dotrzymują akcenty lodów śmietankowych, kakao, marcepanu i mokrej dębiny. Na ostatniej prostej dobiega cukier trzcinowy i melasa.
Zapach układa się w poszczególne warstwy i otwiera się z czasem jak kwiat.

Smak: Na języku, gładziutkie, jedwabiste już od pierwszego łyka.
W ustach rozpływa się mleczna czekolada, kakao, orzechy migdałowe, Nutella i przypalony karmel. Kawa ma słodki profil i umiarkowany stopień nut palonych.
Słodycz wafelków kokosowych, drewna dębowego oraz beczkowej wanilii wypełnia i głaszcze podniebienie.
Posmak cukierków Kopiko oraz Kukułek wypełnionych chrupiącym karmelem i czekoladą, przez długi czas utrzymuje się w ustach. Piwo chociaż ma wysoką pełnię i jest niezmiernie syte i treściwe, charakteryzuje się dość wyraźnym palonym finiszem.
Tekstura jak wcześniej już wspomniałem jest gęsta jak olej silnikowy.
Ukrycie procentów - arcymistrzowskie. 
Sama radość! Sztosiwo warte swojego hajpu! 

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

BBVSS uwodzi smakiem i powala aromatem. 
Kryje w sobie bogactwo różnorodnych nut smakowo-zapachowych. 
Profil beczkowy jest niezapomniany, chociaż kawa nie jest aż tak esencjonalna, jakbym się tego spodziewał. 
Balans i wielowarstwowość to dwie najważniejsze cechy tego trunku. 
Prawdopodobnie najlepsze piwo AleSmith i w 100%-ch najlepsze z serii Speedway Stout.",4.5,-0.453

The pour is a beautiful light orange-tinted golden yellow color with a thicker white head and a couple spots of lace as it falls down to a thin ring. The aroma is spectacular. There is a huge win aspect to it with a light citrus and a ton of stone fruit. I have no idea how this complexity comes, since this is a non-fruited saison. Oh my goodness. The flavor is equally spectacular. The fruitiness, the delicate wheat and light oak, a hint of spice to let you know it’s still a saison. The stone fruits and citrus remain at large, and I just don’t understand how good this is.

Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"The one and only Batch 1, 750mL bottle, drunk 1/19/17 at the brewery.
Light-to-minimal haze in this bronze-golden body with fiery copper hues. Well-carbonated, with a big, off-white head that steadily recedes to cover.
The nose strikes me with two things immediately: one, the tell-tale Hill Farmstead ""micro flora"", if you will, creating light acidity, strong minerality and dry, yellow fruits. And two, LOTS of buckwheat character, giving it an almost vegetal funk (very hard to describe). It’s extremely unique and interesting. Beyond that, light black pepper enters the mix alongside light lemon and soft Brett notes. Over the course of 45 minutes, it really softens and turns quite elegant and incredibly funky, neither becoming too acidic nor fruity. No alcohol nor flaw.
In the mouth it’s still tightly carbonated, though the levels seem much lower now and it adds a bit to the drinkability, leaving a bit of wateriness on the end. Dry, of course, with cereal-like character from the buckwheat adding almost a vegetal, corn, vanilla-like note which is snapped up by light brett and lactic acids. Tart and crisp on the finish with soft black pepper and a touch of oaky tannin.

Background notes of toasted wheat & baked crackers with a perfect funky offset of post-rainstorm hay, straw, & barnyard floor. Touch of earthiness in the finish, ending with a nice combo of mineral & barnyard, a slight hint of stone fruits that linger into a mostly dry finish. Crisp, light, refreshing body.

Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"Bottle (375 ml). 2½ oz pour + 1 oz the day after opening the bottle. Thanks to Matt for the bottle!



Appearance: Deep purple with really nice legs. 



Aroma: A good amount of alcohol at first, but it then settle down as it breathe. Vibrant fresh tart cherries presence with some spiciness, herbal notes and honeyed sweetness. 



Taste: Sweet, but almost perfectly balanced by the acidity and the tartness of the cherries. Here again the cherries are fresh and vibrants. Light to moderate spiciness, honey, a bit boozy and some herbal presence. 



Palate: Medium to full body. Syrupy. Dryer than expected with a nice warming finish from the alcohol and the light spices. Despite being somewhat dry, there’s still some lingering sweetness too (not cloying). 



Overall: This is a damn fine drink! A perfect sipper, except for the fact that it’s too drinkable. It’s probably nearly impossible to do a better job at showcasing the Schaarbeek cherries. Complex, warming and so tasty! The only ""bad"" thing I can say about this one is that, for the price, it’s certainly not 3-4 x better than Black Agnes (in fact I would say that Black Agnes is almost as good if not as good). Now I can’t wait to try Heart of Darkness.

Tuoksussa ensimmäisenä hyppää paahteinen kahvisuus, mutta siihen tulee mukaan lakritsista otetta, hieman ehkä suklaatakin. Hieman soijaa ja kuivattua tummaa hedelmää on huljuttelemalla, mutta kahvisuus kuitenkin hallitsevana. Maussa lakritsi, tumma hedelmäisyys ja tumma  sekä maitosulkaa ovat vahvimmat, kahvisuuttakin on, mutta ei aivan niin vahvasti kuin tuoksussa. Maltaisuus on hyvin paahteista. lähes palaneen tyylistä, soijaakin on. Suutuntuma on hyvin täyteläinen, alkoholi lämmittää mukavasti.

Head: tan, one finger.
Colour: opaque black.
Aroma: coffee with various nuances, chocolate, praline, subtle vanilla, some alcohol.
Taste: medium to full body, soft carbonation, nuanced coffee upfront, following dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, and so on. Rich taste, but mouthfeel remains a bit shallow for the ABV. Only a bit warming.
Very long warming aftertaste like initial taste.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a large, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and coffee and chocolate, as well as lighter dark fruit and hints of licorice and tobacco.

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and tobacco lingerin in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and low/medium carbonation.

This makes for a very enjoyable coffee stout with distinct, but not overdone chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes, while I suspect that a lot of the chocolate and dark fruit comes from the coffee as well as the malts. At the same time, there's a very good roasted and bitter presence to this as well, with some roasted malts and herbal hops, which is just the kind of flavor profile that I'm looking for from a beer like this. It's very well-balanced, with some lightly sweet notes from the dark fruit and caramel malt, as well as more roasted malt and bitter, herbal hops, as well as hints of licorice and tobacco.

Look, I am not an imperial stout lover and I especially don't care for pastry stouts, so take this rating with a grain of salt and don't be insulted. First off, I'm pretty sure this is an imperial stout, not a pastry, not sure how this got into the pastry style but I've been following this brew for a long time and its always been a straight up impy stout - forget about the pastry fad thing. But anyway, form a tap this stuff has a nice smooth impy stout nose, not bad I think. The look in the eye of this is very pleasing, it seems to have legs as I roll it around the glass. It almost seems like its staining the glass. Taste is what else? Its very fine imperial stout, smooth and lacks most all the ill attributes I find in most domestic versions of this. Look, I don't care for impy stouts but this stuff is a little better than most I've tasted and I've tasted tons. It even has a slight sherry effect and I bet it would be great after it aged a few years or ten. Mouthcoating almost sweet finish. I was just glad just to finally have a chance to taste this.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"Black, deep and dark, completely opaque body topped by a khaki head, tall with excellent retention, thick and creamy. A thick wall of lacing is left as it does recede.

Aroma is not strong: roasted coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweet.

Initial taste is vanilla, followed by roasted coffee, then chocolate, then the bitterness from the hops. All of this intermingles nicely throughout. The underlying sweetness of the malts is never more than a background foundation. The foremost flavors are the interacting of chocolate and roasted coffee. The finish is bitter, with the aftertaste being somewhat sweet and bitter with roasted coffee. The bitterness and the roasted malts linger. This is a big beer, but, apart from the expected effects, the alcohol does not become obvious until near the end, when the beer has become well-warmed to room temperature, and even then, it is just a bit of warming at the finish.

The mouth feel is smoothly creamy and moderately thick.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"355ml botttle bought at Cave Beer Point in Mei Foo.

Looks: Opaque deep Cola blackish brown colour with a thin layer of dirt-like yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy beige foam which fades in 10 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with roastyness, strong whipped cream, waffles, tartness, strong Port-like alcohol, strong caramel, sticky toffee, strong milk coffee, chocolate, strong sugar, spices and sweet bread. Nice!

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with roastyness, strong tartness, strong soy sauce, strong black coffee, strong Cola, strong caramel, burnt toffee, burnt toast, cream, strong Port-like alcohol, strong dark chocolate, light floral, sugar, earth, spices, pine needles, dark bread, strong lemon, bitter hops and grass. Yum!

Body: Full body. Oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Full dark maltyness in a viscous background. Oily and, roasty with loads of nice soy sauce and tartness to hit, then comes with blissful booze laced with layers of strong caramel, burnt toast and toffee, cream, black coffee and dark chocolate. As if this is not enough, it’s well covered with piney hops-like spiceness to complement the restrained sweetness with lemony hops to round. I’m not worthy!

Booze: the 12% abv taste like a cross between Port wine and Sherry, the spicyness enhances the booze taste further much like North Coast Old Rasputin. Its present can be felt but is more comfy than aggressive, make it an easy to drink experience. Unbelievable!  

Hoppiness: Spice in nose, same in taste plus earth, pine, lemon and grass; Bitterness - burnt malt and hops - is quite strong and very dynamic for a lasting, close to high-level bitter roasted dark malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Roasty spicy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: RIS usually means an all-out war for the senses, not this one: I can feel the potency through it's rich aroma and taste, but underneath it is very subtle, with waves and layers to impress rather than a straight KO. This is a RIS which is toned to perfection and friendly to experts and newcomers alike. A classic!

750ml bottle poured in a Hill Farmstead taster. (bottle share)

A~ super hazy glowing yellow, not much of a head, and no lacing at all.

S~ tons of fermented honey, white grapes, vinegar and white wine. super strong acidity unlike any brew i’ve ever smelt.

T~ wow! this is crazy unique! pretty much follows the nose with more saison aspects. black pepper and bready yeast. all ending with a strong lemon vinegar tartness.

M~ not very carbonated but thats probably because the sample was saved for me. otherwise super smooth with the texture of dank lemonade. if this was freshly cracked i’m sure this would have had a nearly perfect score.

O~ definitely the most unique brew i’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing! i’m hoping this is still being done again but i’m sure it won’t be the same, this is just too crazy! hopefully its the same kind of wine barrel as well, the white wine/grape aspect is unreal! i seriously hope to have another chance to try this, 2 ounces was not enough!

a lot brighter and way more citrus than batch 1. honey and white wine still very forward. so delicate and amazing all around!

Spilt with some very generous and very hungover bros who I’ve never met before and will probably never see again. It was a perfect medley of honey, wine and funk that was more than the sum of its parts. Shared against the backdrop of the Vermont countryside, it was ethereal in every sense. It was too perfect for you to understand without being there yourself...without the setting, it doesn’t get a 5. Without the magnum it doesn’t get a 5. Without the people I shared it with, it doesn’t get a 5. But...put all those together and you have perfection. In every sense. Without apology and without reservation, this beer is the greatest thing ever brewed, bar none.",5.0,0.9896

Hill Farmstead Ann,"Bottle picked up at Hill Farmstead last February and shared at my wedding on 9/12/15. Pour was a slightly hazy blonde, lively eggshell head that breaks into gorgeous lace and remains throughout. Aromas are very inviting! Notes of oak, vanilla, light honey sweetness, light barnyard funk, medium floral and light earth. Taste is phenomenal! Such a balance of flavors throughout. Less honey and less Brett than the base beer, Anna.....but was a wonderful transformation through the barrel inflection. Nice rounded tartness gives off light hints of underripe apples and grapes...vinous and earthy in the mid-palate. Very much to my liking!! Light funk pushes through the back-end where the honey emerges in harmony with oak/vanilla to counter nicely. Finishes semi-dry, semi-sweet and lightly tart. Wonderful, wonderful beer....for a wonderful, wonderful night!",4.7,0.9926
Hill Farmstead Ann,"May 2014 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.
Hazy burnished copper with a good amount of fairly well-retained white head atop.
Brightness of Anna lightly dulled, but in the best way possible, replacing it with soft lactic acids. Again more of the floral-sulfur-grass thing going on (that’s my closest approximation to describing the aroma of these wonderful saisons, and it’s admittedly terrible and sounds unappealing, but I’ll work on it once I get a whole bottle to myself....). Bits of honey on the end are just begging you to drink it.
Very well-restrained on the barrel character, compared to Art. Bright acidity, wildflower notes producing the same light stickiness. As it progresses, you get a pineapple-near-the-rind sort of flavor that is nicely dry but still has some good tartness and a pinch of sweetness. Bits of vanilla and light wood with some juicier melon notes. Hard to describe, these beers of Shawn’s. The flavors are all so new to me and it’s overwhelming to try them all for the first time this weekend. I can say that the mouthfeel, balance and attenuation are perfect here once again.
2014 375mL drunk 5/26/17 at the brewery.
Was really hoping to try the 2016 batch but they ONLY had the 2014.  DAMN.  Life is hard.
Still smells wonderful; tons of tart acidity, spicy phenols and floral character from the honey with very soft oak and rich honeyed malt tones through it all.  Very clean and much more gentle than when fresh.
Soft and very easygoing in the mouth with a lingering honey-like sweetness, soft wood tannins and lots of grass, juicy pineapple and melon.  The carbonation is very low at this point and maybe the 375mLs haven’t aged as gracefully as the larger format bottles, as this is just a touch tired (I wouldn’t continue aging these small bottles more than a year and would definitely drink them now), though certainly still highly enjoyable.  Bright acidity on the very end still helps enliven things but the tight, almost champagne-like carbonation that make Shaun’s sours so delightful is no longer very present here.",4.6,0.9977
Hill Farmstead Ann,"Magnum poured by Adam, bottled 2014, sold in 2015. Great bright gold color, spotty lace. Aroma is just a dream, honey, grain, citrus, very mild barrel.

Hill Farmstead Ann,"Originally reviewed 10/26/2012. 750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Batch 1 bottle #98. Hazy with a white head. Good retention and lacing. Smells like Anna with wine. Honey and yeasty as hell. Light wine notes and a touch of acidity. Stronger wine presence in the taste. Really quite dominant. Lots of honey still, which cuts the yeastiness more than in Anna. Dry with a little brett. Gets fruitier towards the finish. A touch of grainy malts. Wonderful. Slick from the wine. Light and medium carbonation. Very nice. Low acidity, but it’s there and helps to bring the honey and wine together. Yeasty bitterness.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"$35, only 11% bottle at a small but interesting bottle shop in Grapevine Texas.

Low-ball glass at the employee lodge under a desk lamp.

Pour is a very dark but very clear, syrupy, ruby Robitussin. Some of the cork dusted off into my drink.

Smell is very vinous & stemmy. Slightly medicinal, herby honey. Sharp currants & black cherry pits. There is more honey in the nose than  anticipated.

Taste is oily, lemon honey on the stove when you're sick. Middle kicks in the currant, black cherry, sour plum & Pinot Noir. Lots of skin, but so bittersweet in both directions. The bitterness is leafy, twiggy & constant. The honey body & sweetness propels all the fruit forward, not able to express itself fully. So tart in between. I did want more honey character. It's there in spots, but it's fighting a losing battle with all this fruit. A more robust variety next time.

The body is oily, rich, tannic, warming, thick & inviting.

Side Project Beer : Barrel : Time - 2017,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Side Project Cellar, with Gus, on November 24. 750 mL bottle, black wax. The pour is a nice dark black motor oil with a dark film of espresso colored ring of head with no lace as it lingers. The aroma is great. There is a dark chocolate and heavy roasted malt with a beautiful leathery undertone. A lightly bitter earthy hop comes in late and the vanilla comes through with a strong oak on the finish. This is complex and deep, but the hop is a little too detectable. The flavor is much of the same. The bit bitterness up front works with the light alcohol before the roasted malt, leather, tobacco, and a hint of oak lead away from the hop and finish with an almost dark fruit heaviness. The light vanilla and oak again bring up the back and this warms all the way down. The mouth feel is lighter heavy bodied with a soft carbonation and a nice charred oak and bitter chocolate roasted malt on the finish.

Pours a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown with a small dark tan/brown head that settles into a ring. This is somewhat jarring next to Derivation #8 because, as the description details well, there are no adjuncts in here and D8 is popping with vanilla and coffee and coconut. There is also a lot more balance between barrel and base than the first iteration of BBT on draft, which was called Barrel-Aged Time when it debuted for the Coffee Crawl in 2017. That one, with the old Heaven Hill barrel, was intense in the way it soaked up the barrel, and was bourbon-forward and almost dry. This one certainly has plenty of oak and vanilla and slight char and toasted sugar, balanced by roasted malts and dark chocolate. Medium-plus bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, roasty, rich mouthfeel. Excellent. It's being overshadowed by D8, but that's expected. Great in its own right.",4.4,0.922

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Not my usual genre. Dark strong without an excess alcohol taste. Best drunk slightly chilled for those European winter dried fruits (think Xmas cake or pudding) to come through, too cold and this + spices get demolished. Nice for a change.",4.1,0.836
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Optisch sehr dunkel mahagonifarben. Die hellbraune, feinporige Schaumkrone wirkt flaumig und ""nur"" mäßig gut haltbar, was aber bei einem so hohem Alkoholgehalt nicht wenig verwunderlich ist. Die Duftaromatik verwöhnt mit unglaublich kräftigen Noten von würzigem Waldhonig, dunklem Karamell, leichten Anklängen von Schokolade, Powidl, Dörrobstnoten von Kirsche, Beeren, Pflaume und Feige, ebenso ein Hauch von Sherry und/oder Portwein. Unglaublich komplex! Der Antrunk kommt weichrezent, süß und breit malzig bis reiffruchtig mit leichten Anklängen von Dörrobst und Rumtopf. Im Mund breitet sich ein wuchtiger, wärmender Körper mit sanfter und leicht moussierender Rezenz, schwerer, öliger Textur, leichter Trockenheit und präsenter Süße aus. Auf Zunge und Gaumen zeigen sich komplexe Noten von dunklem Karamell, leichter Schokolade, fruchtigem Dörrobst (Kirsche, Beeren, Pflaume, Feige), leicht rumige Anklänge, die an Rumtopf erinnern und bis in sherry- und portweinartige Noten übergehen. Ich glaube, man kann herauslesen, dass man es mit einer sehr hohen Komplexität zu tun hat, die in ein unfassbares und harmonisches Gesamtbild mündet. Drinkability ist bei 11,3 % (!!!) kein Thema - dennoch wirkt dieses Quadrupel nicht zu schwer oder erschlagend. Im Nachtrunk wirken sämtliche Aromen mit einer leichten Süße, einer schönen Wärme und einer leicht alkoholischen Note sehr gut und lange nach. Erst nach längerer Zeit vernimmt man eine sehr zarte, trockene Herbe, die nach wie vor mit einer angenehmen Schokonote hinterlegt ist.
Fazit: Dieses Bier zählt definitiv zu den allerbesten der Welt!",5.0,-0.9708

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"""Quadrupel"" - ""das stärkste Rochefort"" - ""11,3% vol."" waren alles Stichworte, die mich bewogen haben heute nur ein Bier zu verkosten. Zucker und Weizenstörke fallen auch hier auf. Auf Gewürze wurde verzichtet. Trappistes Rochefort 10 riecht nach Alkohol, Karamell  und Röstaromen. Die beige Schaumkrone ist daumendick, gemischtporig und bleibt dann auf niedrigem Niveau stabil. Die Farbe ist fast schwarz. Beim Antrunk kommen eine komplexe, kaum erfassbare Gschmacksvielfalt auf den Verkoster zu. Trotzdem versuche ich eine grobe Auswahl zu nennen: Sherry, Rosinen, Kaffee, Honig, Wein aus Beerenauslese. Beim Abgang setzt sich Hefe durch und Hopfenbitterkeit stellt sich leicht ein. Der Alkoholgeschmack ist aber so heftig, dass ich mir beim Verkosten viel Zeit lasse. Somit sprechen wir von einer sehr niedrigen Rezenz. Dieses Quadrupel geht an die Grenzen des guten Geschmacks. Für die Fans von Starkbier sicher ein Highlight!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"32 oz. screw-top growler graciously shared by Dave. Originally reviewed 6/29/2012.

Pours an incredibly flat inky black. Glass-staining, as always. Viscous, but no head. Bummer. Growler, maybe?

Nose is brandy, booze, and, well, standard Hunahpu aromas. Chilies and chocolate. And more booze. The brandy aroma is a little on the sickly sweet side, though. Really detracts, I think.

Tastes awfully sweet at the start. Brandy comes through, but it isn’t an imposing flavor, except for the sweetness. Chocolate and chilies are still pretty potent in this treatment. Thick and sweet and syrupy, though. Every bit of sugar is amplified by the brandy.

Thick and boozy. Still has the wonderful viscosity of Hunahpu, though, but it tastes every bit of 11.5% and then some. The sugar doesn’t help.

Not an impressive treatment. It’s still a fascinating combination of flavors, but not something that improves upon the original beer.",3.7,0.9896

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"Sampled from a 0.75l bottle @ Top Hops (BA) Bottle Share. Damn this is black. Doubt the blackness-scale has anything blacker than this and it has a small quickly sidesticking really really deep dark brown top. Lovely nose with chocolate, apples, vanilla, wood, and it’s actually so deep and intense that it’s a little scary. Yeah I said it, I’m a little scared. It’s super smooth in the mouth! Thick, chewy and almost syrupy oily with a soft really prickling and stingy carbonation. It has a pure chocolaty liquefied roasty flavor. Oh my. There is also a soft sharpness in the finish here.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"Original review (2012-07-16): Gloops from the bottle as any Zhukov-based brew should. Tremendous roast in the nose with brandy and caramely notes. Lots of complexity here, though I wish it were more pungent. 



Taste is marvelously complex with brandy, booze, vanilla, spice, and plenty more that end up dancing atop the delicious stout base. Chiles are mild, where they belong. The trademark Hunahpu’s chocolate, vanilla, and chile aftertaste gets a boost from the brandy as it tickles the back of my throat upon swallowing. Ultra-viscous body, as expected, and just amazing.

Bottle 57/84. Opaque black beer, thick dark brown head that dies away quickly. Softish semi dry palate. When cold it’s all about the soft creamy chocolate with dashes of coffee and molasses. As it warms up other  flavours appear - wood and vanilla sweetness. The apple brandy is quite subtle but provides a fruity sour undertone.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"750mL bottled 2/26/21, drunk 11/21/22, thanks Chalameuax!
Undetermined clarity, dark mahogany with deep burgundy highlights in the light.  Medium-sized, tan head shows moderate retention.
Nose is beautiful and well-aged.  None of the unfermented sugars and syrupy fudge that so many stouts have these days.  The adjuncts are done incredibly tastefully, as well with none of it jumping out or dominating.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19

Appearance: Pitch black body, very opaque.  Ther head is dark brown, like melted chocolate.   Texture is tiny bubbles with a few medium around the edges.   The head lingers atop the beer but stays very thin. 

Flavor:  Dark roasted malts, a touch of smoke from the roasted malts, and a rich creamy malt sugar flavor from the malts.   A low hop taste and a nice bit of bittering hops.  Balance is malty and the finish is chocolate, roasted malts and bittering from the Hops. 

Mouthfeel: Body is full, with medium/ high carbonation.   There is a strong alcohol warmth,  and the malt base provides a solid creamy mouthfeel that overshadows the level of carbonation.   There is astringency due to the bittering hops but more from the roasted malts.

Anchorage A Deal With The Devil - Double Oaked 2017,"2017 bottle drunk at the Referend First Anniversary line share, 12/2/17.
Deep mahogany-ruby, good clarity, with a dark beige head that shows moderate retention.
The nose shows rich oak tones that are not heavily toasted, or at least don't give the gross pina-colada character. Rather, spicy bourbon, rich wood and light rum raisin-like notes come through, with surprisingly soft esters, tons of cherry, vanilla, date, brown sugar and good acidity. Certainly some light alcohol, but it's not sharp, messy and it's pretty well-concealed for this abv. Extremely malty, yet it doesn't seem like it's going to be a sugary mess; the balance is definitely there. Furthermore, it's not chock full of specialty malt character, having a strong caramel-honey richness.
In the mouth it's ridiculously soft, creamy and malty, but shows good balance, as fruity, almost melanoidin-like acidity, strong wood and spicy liquor notes all balance the honey-caramel and brown sugar of the malts. The strong cherry-plum fruitiness is excellent and goes a long way to adding depth, while the barrel character adds an element as well, while not dominating the beer. Not syrupy in the least and doesn't feel underfermented. Warming alcohol dries the finish. Low but tight carbonation and no flaw. Damn, after having this masterpiece, I regret never trying any other ADWTDs....",4.3,0.9931
Anchorage A Deal With The Devil - Double Oaked 2017,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 5th Annual Barleywine Tasting at Travis and Nicole’s house on February 03. 375 mL bottle from the 2017 release. The pour is a nice dark brown color with a thick dap of lighter khaki head and a lack of lace as it falls down to nothing. The aroma is fantastic. There is a big time dark fruitiness up front with a sweet cognac and strong oak. A light vanilla and brown sugar come rolling in with a light bourbon on the back end. It almost finishes like a damn cookie. This thing is just awesome. The flavor is much of the same. The bit sweetness up front really draws you in, letting the caramel, toffee, and dark fruits take you over. The cognac and light oak balance out the alcohol before the bourbon and a light vanilla come in to round this thing off. Really freaking good. The mouth feel is thick and heavy bodied with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly alcohol present, dark fruit and caramel finish with a light charred oak on the back end.

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"In short: A big fat viscous chocolaty stout with an almost espresso-like coffee character.  Excellent (even if a bit overrated).

How: Fresh growler.  Sent to me by GodOfThunder, consumed within days of receiving it.  Thanks a lot Jay

The look: Pitch black body topped by a small brown head
 
In long: Nose is showing a roasted coffee beans over a chocolate cake.  Given the hype of the beer I expected a more explosive aroma. Body is thick and viscous as hell.  Somehow, the body felt more viscous than the base Marshall Zhukov, which is strange because usually I find that the coffee version of a big stout (example: Meph Addict vs Mephistopheles) makes for a dryer more roasted sensation.  Taste is pretty straightforward, a big fattening rich chocolate cake with fresh coffee beans.  I’m sure not familiar with the flavor of the much talked about Kopi Lowak coffee variety but to me the Final Push coffee character was a bit more espresso than with other well known high-quality coffee stouts (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.).  Of all the quality coffee stouts I’ve had I’d say that Final Push was the most chocolaty I’ve had.  Actually I don’t think the coffee outshines the chocolate or vice-versa.  Alcohol is a bit apparent but it is fitting for this dessert beer.  Also some green herbal notes.  Carbonation was relatively smooth, I would have preferred a more active carbonation to increase drinkability but maybe it is because it was a growler consumed a week after it was filled.  So despite my long rambling, all I can really say about this beer is that it is a rich chocolate cake and coffee with some alcohol warmth and light green herbal notes.  Even after drinking a full growler I really cannot add anything.  It is   a straightforward but highly enjoyable sipper.  In a blind tasting I don’t think it would score higher than the less hyped widely available quality coffee stouts out there (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.) but it remains an excellent example of the style.  And in case you drank the beer but don’t know why the beer is named “Final Push”… well, you don’t want to know, just like you don’t want to know if your mother ever kissed your goodnight after giving your father a blowjob.",4.1,0.9919

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Tap at the BA Hunahpu release 9/24/11. Thanks to drowland for saving me a pour of this rarity. You are the man!

Pour is typical Zhukov, an ink black SRM that produces a Martian red head looking extremely similar to used motor oil. Bubbles and all. Lots of glass staining but not a lot of head retention and lacing. Nose is quite nice. I’m not the biggest coffee fan, but can appreciate having hazelnut, vanilla, cinnamon apples, and cocoa powder in the nose in lieu of near DMS like qualities and sharp, gritty roast. Rich and soft in the nose thankfully. For taste, I still think the palate is what shines above taste. Palate is rich and oily. Extremely thick but no cloying sugars like you would expect given the staining. Instead, the coffee does pack decent bitterness (no astringency) but there is still such a hefty dose of coffee acidity creating a tart lemon profile in the back end. Certainly yummy, but someone may see this as simply extremely thick coffee rather than imperial stout. Could use more bitterness and could work on the appearance department. If you are going for this whale, I hope you enjoy coffee explosion.",3.9,0.9922

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Thanks to ______, I had an opportunity to try this at the 2nd Pgh Tasting on the 2nd. I’m not telling you who gave me a glass from the screw top bottle because I don’t want him to get hatemail because of me!  Either way, I was really glad to have the chance to rate a beer that floridians consider one of the best, heheh. First off, my immature palate is not refined enough to be allowed to rate such a refined(?) big beer, so sue me. If you are a lover of CC then take my number and subtract it from 5 and get your real rating. From the beginning I knew this was going to be something else; weird looking screw top squatty bottle with a lable that had hand written FINAL PUSH on it. Pouring into the glass it looks like used 50W shovelhead motor oil. Coating the glass it seems to be staining it dark brown. Smell? Atttack of coffee on the olfactory. Did I say it smells like big coffee espresso? Sorry, I just recovered after hitting my head on the wall behind me. No head. Initially, all I tste in this stuff is big black triple espresso cold. Perhaps there is some alky in there but the flavor is so overwhelming coffee I can’t stand it; over the top and way too much personality for this mockery of a beer. I don’t know how stuff like this can be considered beer. OK, after my taste buds recover I do taste come tobacco and pepper in there, perhaps. From beginning to end this is nothing new in the coffee stout scene. Yes, special, perhaps but there are so many other beers out there with these characteristics; over the top roto-tilling burnt coffee and a little alky. Finish reminds me of grampa’s cold espresso with whiskey in it. Big thanks to the guy, you know who you are, that gave this too me to rate. I am very fortunate to have had the chance to taste this.  However, it reminds me of the big let down I experienced when tasting all those top 50 impy stouts when I first started rating beers here.",1.9,0.9897

aroma is unlike any beer i’ve ever experienced. absolutely stunning with the most intense, rich, world class espresso, charred french roast, fruity, freshly harvested coffee beans, and a touch of spiced, mexican blend and backed by elegant, pure dark chocolate, toasted hazelnuts, and hints of vanilla with subtle notes of cinnamon and topsoil as it warms in my CCB snifter. i literally spent 10 minutes savoring the aroma before taking a sip! so long, in fact, LJ started laughing at me and she’s seen me rate hundreds of beers before this one. flavor is almost indescribable. just on a completely different level than mere mortal imperial coffee stouts with a massive onslaught of rich espresso, freshly roasted $100/lb coffee, and bitter, slightly fruity, spent grinds with a sublime balance offerred by rich, semi-sweet fudge, vanilla, and subtle molasses with hints of fresh cinnamon, dark fruits, and cigar ash on the back end. palate is nothing short of perfect. i mean, this ""shit"" drinks like a damn frappacino with a silky, slick texture, perfect carbonation, and the most intense, chocolate, roasted coffee finish i’ve ever experienced. overall, truly a sublime beer. no way i can rate this any less that a perfect 5 as it’s definitely one of the absolute best beers i’ve ever tasted.",5.0,0.9966
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Growler shared by hophead84 at Woodshop6. Pitch black pour that is extremely glass coating with a small iodine head. Looks good as do most CCB stouts. Aromas are strongly of coffee. To the point of being a bit peppery. Earthy, spicy coffee notes, chocolate, fudge, alcohol. A bit sweet. Flavors are very bitter chocolate and roast. Some coffee notes as well. Big syrupy and warming mouthfeel. Coating. Tasty, but I preferred the coffee notes in Kopi Speedway quite a bit more.",4.2,0.6128
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Sampled side by side with the Penultimate.  Pretty much the same beer, but I thought it was too mellow.  I didn’t realize that the coffee was super high end.  I didn’t get a whole lot of coffee in this one, unfortunately.  Rich chocolate and roasted malts.  A nice beer that I’d love to try again.  Thanks Kan!",4.1,0.9774
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"growler courtesy of askdrtodd, thanks a ton! wow! what a beer. this really is a top notch stout, no way around it. beautiful pour, took some good height to achive a good head, and the beer is by no means lacking of carb in the body afterwards. the body is very very viscous, super oily, dark brown head with long lasting cascading action and decent lacing and spotting, beautiful beer. the coffee is the star of the show through and through in this beer, hands down. huge roasty aroma, tons of chocolate, delicious. the taste and body are incredible. tastes like a mocha milkshake, super creamy carbonation and very thick full body. what a terrific beer. i really am blown away by this, its been a minute since ive had a stout of this caliber. this is as good as surly four was fresh. worth the hype when in top form.",4.8,0.9941
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Another gem courtesy of KAN!  Poured basically black with a lovely cap of dark tan head.  The aroma picked up a whole bunch of delicious coffee and roasty black malts, with touches of vanilla, nutty, and earthy notes.. excellent nose!  The flavor was somehow a notch better, and consistent with the hype machine.. delicious coffee throughout, accented by burnt chocolate and molasses.. heavy roast, but the balance held perfectly.. more coffee and warm boozy undertones on the finish.. absolutely no complaints.  Heavy-bodied with moderate carbonation on the palate.. a lot of coffee, and even more deliciousness!",4.5,0.9825
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout,"Wow - just as everyone else gave this one mad props, so will I as it deserves. Thanks for opening the growler Vince. It pours very similar to the Hunahpu’s with a dark thick black oil-like appearance and the perfect caramel and dark cinnamon color super-lacey head. The aroma has huge delicious smooth coffee notes and light chocolate notes. The flavors of that coffee come through amazingly - as another review stated - better than the best coffee beer AND best coffee I’ve ever tasted! There are some chocolate and roasty notes too, but nothing tastes as good and shines through on this impy stout like the coffee. Then the body, like Hunah, is creamy, thick but smooth, and perfectly carbonated. That creaminess with the coffee notes are soooo good.",4.7,0.982

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so…). Thick and very frothy, off-white, lightly lacing and slowly opening but largely stable head on a misty straw blonde robe with warm peachy tinge and lively sparkling - looking like a bottle of no more than a year old. Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth. Before I get even more lyrical: among the most masterful geuzes I ever had the pleasure to taste, one I had been dreaming of for a long time, and one to reverentially bow one's head for when it happens to cross one's path. Granting it a perfect score is the only option I have on this site.",5.0,0.9989

I believe it was around 50F temp when served.



A - First pour was a burnt dark orange / gold appearance. The cork had a HUGE pop exploding but not gushing. GREAT SIGN! First pour was a 5 finger solid white huge bubbly head. Subsequent pours got more cloudy obviously. Dregs were dark brown w/ hints of red.



S - Nose is a mix of blue cheese, cardboard basement musk and funk with a lot of wood, mold and more cheese the 3F funk with lemon nose is there but super subdued. Reminds of the same funky moldy basement funk that I got from Blauw.



T - a know what....taste is pretty freaking awesome. Yes a lot of cardboard and shoe polish. A lot of leather and wood and moldy grapes. But it’s incredibly tart and well done. Lots of lemon, cloth aged old cheddar and funk classic 3 F. Tart overall. 



M - Bursting classic 3F mouthfeel. Bubbly, filling and huge.

Taste is a bit subdued on all accounts. Nice lemony bite, cobwebs, hay, and mineral funk, but with the same floral aspect, and a touch of mint on the finish. Drinkable, and only a touch dirty on the back of the throat. Medium dryness. A privilege to try this one, but I think it falls short of other geuzes of similar age.",4.0,0.3506
3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"75cl bottle at Akkurat. Not on the list. It pours a golden/light amber colour with a large white head. Aroma is nice and complex: wet wood, strong funkyness with fruitiness and some spiciness. Nice acidic notes, recalling the classic cheesey and horseblankety notes. Taste is rich with strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness. Huge citrus and lemon peel notes. Grassy notes in the background. Some wood and fruit too. Mostly dry finish. Palate is creamy, silky, with good carbonation. So easy to drink, I’m glad I had a whole bottle for myself. This is now rounded, complex, almost on par with the Millennium.",4.5,0.9819

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"Bottle at Mikkeler Bar SF.
Aroma is nice and complex with an amazing earthiness and herbal note to it. Light citric acidity to compliment the beer. Musty hay and barnyard notes to compliment. Almost no acetic note. Herbal character is a touch minty. 
Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a fairly big, light pillowy head that recedes until it is just a film along the top and edges. The film persists for quite some time. 
Flavor has a bit more citrus than the aroma and has a touch less barnyard character. Flavor still has quite a bit of that earthy, herbal note. Really pleasant balance of acidity and funk. The moderate acidic note is clean and citrusy while very smooth and not in your face. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Such a nice silkiness to this beer which is shocking for an acidic beer. 
Overall an amazingly complex beer with so much nice earthy notes, barnyard notes, some hay and really light, pleasant acidity. The two most noticeable things are the clean acidity and the herbal note. The acidity works so well and the herbal note is slightly minty and refreshing for a geuze.",4.7,0.9856

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary),"2 x 3 oz pour from a bottle @ The Festival (Portland). When I drank it, I thought it was regular 1998 Oude Gueuze, but I was confirmed after that it was the 50th anniversary. My oldest lambic so far. Hazy golden/orange with a small to medium white head and little lacing. Aroma is so enticing with barnyard, green apple, musty notes, light banana(?), funk, horse blanket and fruity notes. Taste is slightly sweet and moderately funky with barnyard, horse blanket, green apple, musty notes, fruits, earthy notes and light lemony presence. Mouthfeel is dry. Still well carbonated. I’m really impressed by how good and multi-layered this gueuze is, even after 15 years. This is amazingly complex, but what is even more impressive is how well balanced this Gueuze is. That would be a perfect everyday gueuze. Incredibly drinkable. Not far behind J&J Blauw (and on par with Lente) for my top gueuze (and top beer) ever!

EDIT: Had it again, this time at Akkurat. Still a world-class beer but it was not in the same league as the Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1999 we head the day after and the regular Oude Geuze 2002 that I had a few hours before. It was heavier than the first time I had it.",4.6,0.9853

Midnight Sun M,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 5/18/2014.
Dark body. Nearly black. Small khaki head.

Nose is sherry and a bit of cardboard oxidation. Sweet brown sugar and caramel. Mild dark roasted malts.

Tastes sweet. Sherry flavored oxidation. Caramel. Some roasted malts. Dates. Not any barrel, really. Lots of raisin fruitiness.
Thick bodied. Sweet, but not overly so. Alcohol is still prevalent.

Great!",4.7,0.8955
Midnight Sun M,"Extreme & manifold thanks to kermis!!! 650 ml. bottle sampled. 2005 Vintage presumably. Nose carries clear oxidation over a sweet base of caramel syrup, toffee, thick malts & sugar. While unfavorable oxidation, thinned by age is clear in the nose, I found none in the taste which is extremely sublime. Taste is insane richness, thick toffee malts, sweet vanilla, almond, sweet walnut syrup, warming perfect sugar syrup, warming, soft carbonation, faint fruits leading into an almost chocolate-like finish. Really builds supreme complexity. I expected it to be past its point & just hype but this turned out to be amazingly supreme. Too bad that they don’t know how to remake it.",4.9,0.937

Midnight Sun M,"Thanks to Hallinghansen for the bottle. Much, much appreciated. 

Dark brown color, light tan head that falls away quickly to a thin layer. Thick ABV legs on the sides of the glass. 
Nose starts off oxidized but falls off to prunes, cherries, figs, brown sugar, red grape and Belgian chocolate. After the oxidation this nose is top notch. No hints of bourbon or oak though. 
Taste is very complex. Belgian chocolate, red grape, red cherries, figs, plumbs, brown sugar, and red wine. Very vinous. At the end it did get bourbon, coconut and vanilla.
Long lasting in the palate. Sweet and sticky. Big mouth on this. The long lasting feel is what set this apart from anything else I have had. 
Has it dropped off?? Probably but still world class in a massive way. Few fresh ones can come close to this. Worth what gave up to get this. Only a couple of none BA versions come close to this beer. Must have been a beast a few years ago.",4.1,0.9099

 I feel that drinking this on the same night as completing the top 50. This marks an end to a very long fun journey to seek the best and drink the best. I will still continue to tick, but try to focus my efforts more towards local quality and sharing with friends, rather than saving and trading for the next best thing. Anyways, on to the rating. Poured an intimidating very dark brown to black with a miniscule beige head. Aroma was Bourbon soaked dark fruits, digs, prunes, caramel, toffee and light oxidation
 Flavor was incredibly balanced, figs, berries light roast, vbourbon, toasted caramel, light vanilla, and only mild booze. Incredible how this has held up after 9 years.

The beer is 9 years old at this point but the bottle looked brand new. It pours a thick dark brown, nearly black without a head. Some bubbles rise to the surface. The aroma is of oxidation, must, caramel, butterscotch, dust, slight chocolate, dark fruits like candied raisins. The taste is sweet, tastes like liquid caramel and raisins. It is almost like a lighter JW Lee’s. The beer was definitely built to last for awhile. The mouthfeel is medium thick even with the lack of much carbonation.

Midnight Sun M,"One of the most special bottles I have had the honour to taste. Thanks to Jeffo! I am quite critical when it comes to hypes, but this one lives up to it, and beyond... With some background in wine tasting, the M is one of the few beers where all of the individual aroma and taste components have beautifully merged into a ""bouquet""’, just like wine. One of the richest aromas ever experienced in beer: a perfect fruitiness (raisins, lots of raisins, figs, dates, dark prunes, plums and Belgian syrup aka ""poepspijs"") balanced in the most perfect way with sourness and sweetness. This is so much more than a beer... this is nothing less than divine.",5.0,0.9848

Liquified Belgian candi sugar dominates the aroma. Some roastyness and bourbon, oak, hints of smoke too. Smells pretty nice, but the taste is where this baby shines.  Torrents of flavor pummel my taste buds, imparting liquified candi sugar, sticky caramel, mild licorice, miles of complexity. Boozy warmth at the end doesn’t bite like others do. Low carb = fantastic.  Jesus this is good. One of the very best liquids I’ve ever consumed.",4.6,0.9828

M is achievement, a moment, the end of a long search in a hobby of ""what’s next?"" Our bottle celebrated friendship, years of joint efforts, trips, tastings, and thousands of miles. Today it was a 6hr project to buy, transport, build, and then use a ping pong table long into the night. M is still really good just no longer great. But that’s not why you go after it.
 Thank you Chris. 
Thank you Jeremy.",3.8,0.9572
Midnight Sun M,"A much sought after bottle for me. Pours deep brown, near black, with a wispy ring around the edges. Nose is dates, light soy, kind of mild but pleasant, meatier than expected. Mouth is very refined, old tasting. A lot of rum soaked dates, sweet rum cake. Sweet and full of dates and cake along the finish. Some smoke, coconut sugars open up. Feel is thick, full, silky. Elegant, regal, very nice. Quite sweet, cake like, marshmallow sweets. I would have loved to have enjoyed this 5 years ago but I won’t sully this moment with those thoughts.",4.2,0.9933

Some gentle biscuit, toast. Initial is a bit thicker, firm body with mellow oxidation. Touches of caramel, toast and toffee. A bit thinner, more approachable, mellow warm$$th. Some gentle toast, vanilla and biscuit. A bit oxidized, touch of cardboard and age. Middle is a touch sticky, carmelized, mellow oak and gentle warmth. Finish is a touch sticky, some vanilla, oak and biscuit. Mellow toasty. A bit past it’s prime but a pleasure to try. Some toastiness, biscuit, and oak sticks on to the backend.

Midnight Sun M,"Second to last bottle I have left. Fantastic Barley Wine from Midnight Sun. Unbelievably smooth for a Bourbon barrel aged ale. I’ve had this beer 3 times and it appears to age well with the tobacco and burnt sugar notes significantly increasing with age. The funny thing about this beer was I obtained a number of bottles (8) for around $40. total and recently sold a single bottle for $4500.00. The beer is good but not worth that price. During this review, I did  a cross comparison with a 1953 Truman’s No. 1 Barley Wine Coronation Year. Suprisingly, I found the 1953 Truman’s better than the Midnight Sun M.",4.2,0.8294

Nose...smells just like Don Pedro Ximenez but with crushed dates, Brooks prunes and dark fruit cake. Palate...delicately carbonated with an immediate rush of Christmas cake and fruit bar. Next comes the waves of dark raisins, medjool dates and dark currants followed by a slightly bitter burnt brown sugar hit and a plush yet semi-tannic mouthfeel that adds an interesting  dimension to the experience. This is a truly unique and rare beer!",4.8,0.3882

Some sweet caramel, a mild to moderate oxidation, and a fair amount of chocolate. Sweet brown sugar and caramel notes which go nicely with the fruit, bourbon, and vanilla. Mild chocolate, some oxidation, molasses, and a hint of alcohol.",4.2,0.93
Midnight Sun M,"I want to start off by saying thank you to the generous BA who shared this with a few of us last night.  I definitely thought trying this one was beyond my reach.  ""We are but mere mortals in the presence of M.""  Indeed.

Pours extremely dark for a barleywine, dark mahogany brown, with a small beige head.  It looks almost like a Belgian dark in color, almost black.

Aroma is outstanding and has clearly held up to the years in the bottle.  It’s a good bit fruiter than I was expecting, certainly more than the typical barleywine.  Lots of raisins and plums mixed with chocolate and caramel.  The oak is present with some light tannins, leather and booze.

The taste just doesn’t live up to the aroma though it’s still extremely good.  This is clearly where the age is beginning to catch up to M, with hints of oxidation creeping in.  The booze soaked dark fruits are in the forefront, but with a chocolate-covered character to the whole thing.  The finish is a mixture of port, oak and the oxidized notes.

The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and softly carbonated.  Hides the alcohol exceptionally well
.
This is one of the more complex barleywines I’ve ever had and the nose really stands up to anything I’ve ever smelled in the style.  I have to imagine that this would have been one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted if I had it 2-3 years ago.  As it is, I feel lucky to have been able to try it and it has held up much better than could be expected.",4.4,0.9938
Midnight Sun M,"Wow...bottle shared by scraff. Thanks a lot, Scott!

The beer appears a dark, chestnut brown color and displays a small, oily, beige head. Only sparse lacing is left behind as well as an oily, filmy layer that coats the snifter.

The aroma shows a bit of age and a myriad of scents, to include figs, raisins, plums, oak, booze, maple, brandy, toffee, caramels.

The beer is rich and luxurious, yet light on the palate somehow. Smooth and velvety, a silky feel. The flavor resembles a fine tawny port or sherry. Dark fruits coated with brown sugar. A delicate sweetness is present throughout. A light, warming booze presence, but unobtrusive. This beer goes down effortlessly. What an experience.",4.3,0.8268
Midnight Sun M,"Thanks Mike for bringing this epic bottle. Another bottle I never thought I’d have the honor of trying, thank the lord for Epic Tres! Pours a dark brown with some reddish hues when held to the light. Good carbonation on the pour. Nose opens up with honey and caramel, then moves onto more caramel, dark fruit, light booziness, cocoa, and oak. Tastes slightly oxidized, but it’s still a phenomenal barleywine. Caramel, honey, chocolate, malt, dark fruit, some light brown sugar, and molasses. Exceptionally smooth, not really boozy at all, low carbonation, and a long finish. Not just a product of hype, M is a real damn good beer. While it may be slightly past it’s peak, it is still one of the best barleywines I’ve ever had. Thanks again Mike.",4.7,0.9365
Midnight Sun M,"Huge, huge thanks to Scott for opening this bottle and giving me the opportunity to try some.  Served in a Midnight Sun goblet.  Pours a very dark brown with a thin light tan head that recedes fairly-quickly, leaving behind a few spots of lacing as it falls to a thin collar.  The nose has loads of dark fruits with plum and raisin being prominent.  The background is a bit of caramel and toffee with very mild esters.  Some barrel character is there, though it’s in the background.  The flavor adds in a touch of port character along with a very mild oak and vanilla presence.  Not the most complex that I’ve had, but quite good.  Body is medium with low carbonation and a slight viscosity.  Smooth with no noticeable alcohol.  Overall, a very delicious beer that I would have at any time.  However, at this point, I’d say that things like King Henry and perhaps Kuhnhenn BB4D are equal or better.  Still, what a damn fine experience.",4.2,0.9557
Midnight Sun M,"Dark brown in color, clear with a thin head.  Nice dried fruit aroma with alight Belgian yeast lingering.  The flavor was fruity and sticky sweet.

Midnight Sun M,"Bottle, courtesy tpd75. Pours a very dark brown, red highlights, with fuzzy lacing and a bubbly head. Nose is big on caramel, wood, sherry, licorice, dry vanilla. Pretty routine barley wine nose, but the flavor kicks it up quite a bit. Huge, very smooth malts, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, lots of fine alcoholic, but smooth, malty notes. Sooooo good, extremely complex; each sip presented new flavors and elements not noticed in the previous one. I really liked this one, would love to have more, but I doubt I’ll ever get another shot. Thanks Greg!",4.7,0.9741
Midnight Sun M,"Barleywine Rating #200!  

Pours a striking mahogany with thin tan head. The aroma is caramel covered graham cracker and black strap molasses as well as musty aged figs, dates and plums. It smells of smooth yum and is very inviting. The taste is smooth rich creamy goodness with aged minced raisins fully populating a thick slice of pumpernickel and then moving into sweet black strap molasses, creamy caramel and then rich smooth blended notes of prunes, figs and dates. It evens out into the finish a bit with soft notes of chocolate and burnt molasses. This tastes fantastic and doesn’t overwhelm with syrupiness by ending with a high degree of drinkabilty. In fact, I can see myself drinking a little of this every night.",4.7,0.9642

Midnight Sun M,"Sample from a bottle at Logan’s pre-GABF party 2009.  Pours black with an average, frothy, light brown head, somewhat diminishing with fair lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (caramel, toffee, nutty), light hop (herbs), average yeast (leather) with notes of raisin, date, port, and brown sugar.  Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and an astringent finish.  Long duration, heavy sweetness, light acidity and bitterness.",4.6,0.6412
Midnight Sun M,"Consumed August 29, 2009. To date this has to be the most amazing beer I have ever had. The hype surrounding this beer is not what even made it, the beer is actually ridiculously good and so original and complex. Dark rich brown color with no head. Pours so thick and rich and just looks smooth. Aroma has chocolate, cream, molasses, cake and some rich dark candied fruit. Flavor is really complex. Rich dark chocolate and sundae syrup. Some alcohol warms you right up but isn’t overpowering at all. Some fruit jam and lots of sweetness finish this off. Awesome!",4.8,0.9728
Midnight Sun M,"I want to start out with a huge thank you to hoppymeal for trading his only other bottle of M!  

Looks black or very dark brown from a distance, but when held to light has some very dark red colors to it.  Excellent clarity on the beer.  The head is tan colored and hangs around well leaving a decent lacing.  Aroma jumps out of the glass with burnt sugar, molasses, sour cherries, mint, rum, bourbon, oak, plum, raisins, and Christmas cookies.  Intense and complex smell, but everything smells so delicious.  Taste is full of brown sugar, molasses, huge amount of caramel, cherries, bourbon, and vanilla.  Mouthfeel is full, but so damn smooth, not cloying at all.  Low carbonation and full body cause this to slide over the tongue delivering deliciousness to every taste bud possible.  A beautiful beer to drink, I could sip on this beer all day, but sadly I don’t ever think I’ll see a bottle again.

As much as I had built this beer up in my mind after finding out everything I could about it, I didn’t think it would be able to live up to what I believed it to be.  Somehow, M knew my expectations and instead of breaking under the pressure, it stood strongly and proudly saying take it or leave it.  Take it, I will.  Simply M-mazing!",4.9,0.9831
Midnight Sun M,"Huge thanks to hoppymeal, pepsican, badbeer, and iowaherkeye.Low carbonation. Really smooth finish. Lots of fruit. Moderately sweet. fig & currant. Nice caramel, chocolate, slight butterscotch. Plums. Finishes with lots of chocolate & caramel. Some burnt sugar.",4.3,0.875
Midnight Sun M,"Pours a reddish brown with a nice sized tan head.  Aroma has a nice bit of chocolate, raisin, cherry, plums, old pears.  Flavor was up front chocolate and caramel.  Lots of sweet fruits are also dominate,  mainly plums and cherries.  It definitely has a light amount of sherry and cardboard oxidation that isn’t quite distracting yet,  but I could see it getting in the way soon.  A bit of bourbon, vanilla, bubblegum, and toffee round this one out.  The mouthfeel and finish are damn near perfect.  I always want to hate aged beer,  but I can’t with this.  Awesome.",4.2,0.8543
Midnight Sun M,"Pour was very dark brown with a small tan head.  The aroma was sugary chocolate, vanilla and oak.  The body was medium to thick with low carbonation, which fit well.  The taste was plenty of sweet chocolate with hints of port and raisins.  Really good stuff.",4.4,0.8268
Midnight Sun M,"Bottle cracked open to celebrate my 35th birthday.  Pours dark brown with some off white bubbles around the rim of the snifter.

Midnight Sun M,"22oz bottle, special thanks to Tim at a BA cellar party. I thought I had missed this one and would never get the chance to try it but happened to be in the right place at the right time with some of the coolest people on the planet. Poured into a tulip at cellar temp, about 4 years old at the time of tasting. Deep brown with a tiny head that swirled around the glass like the milky way galaxy. Aroma was very complex, oak, bourbon, prunes, toffee, caramel. The taste was mostly sweet but was cut perfectly by the wood and alcohol flavors. Not syrupy like I imagined it but silky smooth with mild carbonation, age may be thinning this out to perfection. From the others in the room that have had this before, sounds like it just keeps getting better and still hasn’t peaked. Maybe, if I’m lucky the beer gods will rain down blessings of “M” again in the future. Some beers rate high because of their limited availability and lore but this is not one of them, to date the best beer I’ve ever had.",4.6,0.9902
Midnight Sun M,"From my backlog dated September 6th:
22oz bomber shared by an extremely generous individual. 



Dark nearly opaque pour with hardly a drop of head.  Nearly devoid of carbonation.  Ominous.  Aromas of oloroso sherry with bits of vanilla.  Deep and absorbing.  Bizarre flavour.  Triple, barley wine and light bourbon barrel stout all rolled into one.  Wow.  Finally, someone who managed to pull off integrating various attributes of very different styles of beer.  Not only succeeded, but really excelled.  Deep vinous character that morphed into various layers of complexity.  Very nice mouthfeel that just enhanced the experience.  Some additional sherry notes on the end that give away its age.  Just such a unique beer with very separate and unique components that somehow manage to balance and compliment each other wonderfully.  



Many thanks Jason for sharing such an elusive beer.",4.5,0.9838

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"10/6/2023. Bottle shared at SBGP3. From Beer Republic online store. Pours thick, black with a rich tan coloured head. Great pour.

Full bodied, creamy, soft carbonation. Lovely.",4.3,0.9371
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),".355 in Kroken while trying to enjoy Manchester United's Europa League visit to the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. While I am arguably late to the party Founders' products have increasingly become my go-to brewery over the last couple of years due to the nigh on unbeatable combination of relatively low cost and - crucially - consistently very high quality of their products. I am yet to be disappointed and would argue that Founders is among the beer-aficionado's best friends in these trying times for our world.

Having said that, the deep dark brown slightly oily, murky body of this brew is perhaps not the most inviting. The espresso-coloured head does help improve the looks along with the crocheted lacing. 

Given the alcohol level the first impressions of the aroma are perhaps lighter, less pungent and invasive than one would hope for and expect. Not that it is anything wrong with that, not at all. Regardless, the main impressions are of smoky, slightly bittersweet roasted malts with notes of wet charcoal, freshly baked brown bread and spices. The sweet component might be something akin to vanilla or similar.

The flavour is at first distinctly sweeter when compared to the aroma. Again, this is not a problem, the KBS gives you an initial bitter smack on the snout before soothing you with its sweet touch. This reviewer always enjoy beers where the combination of aroma and flavour are distinctly different but come together to produce a great experience. The dark malts are still there, but the bitterness is less prominent in the notes of cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee. The characteristics of bread and vanilla from the aroma are joined by bourbon barrels leading into a long, dry and bitter finish. One could argue that the finish is too bitter and dry for some, and I might agree at least on some level. Regardless, this combination of aroma and flavours will take you on a rollercoaster-like brewbased thrillride.

All in all the experience is helped by one of the most pleasing palates this reviewer has come across recently. Very much full-bodied, quite creamy, and slightly oily. I swear, this is (even) better than it sounds.

Given my previous Founders reviews this is perhaps getting boring, but this comes - again - very much recommended. Great stuff!",4.0,0.9767

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Pours absolutely pitch black (I put a flashlight against the other side of the glass.  Nothing.) with a thick chocolate milk colored head that is in no hurry to go anywhere.  Aroma is chocolate croissant with roasted grain and nuts.  Mouthfeel isn’t as think as the pour would suggest, but certainly had a texture.   The first few sips blew me away.  What shot right though the middle was a vegetal, almost green bell pepper streak that I wasn’t expecting at all.  It was enveloped by what you might expect.  Subtly sweetened croissant, toasted grains and yes a touch of a bourbonish aftertaste (not the aftertaste of the beer, the aftertaste of a sip of bourbon).   Again, the vegetal taste really stands out to me in a spectacular way.  This is more savory than sweet and I wasn’t expecting it.  The aftertaste of the beer is not bitter, more toasted, and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome.  There’s absolutely some warmth in the back of the throat.  The complexity is astonishing.  I cannot believe it has taken me this long to have this. An all time great.",4.5,0.9815

Superstition Blue Berry White,"Sample from 500 ml bottle, batch 4. Huge thanks to SinH4 for providing this gem and Werckmeister for arranging the sample!
Dark ruby-purple body.
Amazing aroma with loads of sweet, jammy blueberries, fruit gum, honey, some vanilla, subtle chocolate.
Delicious, jammy taste, with sweet, deep blueberries, fruit gum, honey, some sourish berry skin, with a bit more white chocolate coming through, some oak, some booze.
Medium, oily mouthfeel, without carbonation.
Finishes perfect, moderate warm, sweet, jammy, with honey, blueberries, some oak and the white chocolate very prominent finally, that stays forever.

Wow, as amazing as i was hoping for!! Extremely rich, with the most lovely, jammy blueberries throughout and the white chocolate beautifully taking over towards the finish. Sweet and thick, but perfectly balanced, not sticky at all. Enjoyed the Grand Cru Berry even a bit more, but this is also crazy delicious stuff!
