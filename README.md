# Building-a-Crowdsourced-Recommender-System-for-Craft-Beers
In this project, we created a crowdsourced recommender system for craft beers based on user reviews from beeradvocate.com.

## Project Summary: **Building a Crowdsourced Recommender System for Craft Beers**

In this project, we built a **crowdsourced recommender system** for craft beers, using user reviews from **beeradvocate.com** to recommend the top 3 beers based on user preferences for specific beer attributes. The steps we followed include:

### 1. Data Collection:
- We scraped around **5-6k reviews** from the **top-rated beers** section of beeradvocate.com, ultimately using **1700-2000 reviews** for our analysis. The dataset contained columns for **product name**, **product review**, and **user rating**.

### 2. Attribute Selection:
- We performed a word frequency analysis on the reviews to identify important beer attributes (e.g., fruity, malty, robust). These attributes served as the basis for further analysis.

### 3. Cosine Similarity Calculation:
- Using the **bag-of-words model**, we calculated **cosine similarity** between the user-specified attributes and the beer reviews. Higher similarity scores indicated a stronger match with the userâ€™s preferences.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis:
- We performed **sentiment analysis** using **VADER** to assess the tone of each review (positive, neutral, or negative), which contributed to the overall evaluation of each beer.

### 5. Evaluation Score:
- By combining the **similarity scores** and **sentiment scores**, we generated an **evaluation score** for each beer, helping us rank the beers and recommend the top 3 products based on user preferences.

### 6. Word Embeddings Comparison:
- We compared the **bag-of-words model** to **word embeddings** using **spaCy**, analyzing the differences in recommendations generated by these two methods.

### 7. Recommendation Results:
- After ranking the beers by evaluation score, we explored how recommendations would differ if we relied solely on the highest-rated beers, offering insights into the limitations of ratings-based recommendations.

### 8. Similarity Between Beers:
- We used **cosine similarity** to identify the most similar beer among a set of 10, demonstrating how similarity metrics can be used to find competitive products.

## Conclusion:
This project utilized **natural language processing** (NLP), **cosine similarity**, and **sentiment analysis** to develop a recommender system for craft beers, providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences and review sentiment.
